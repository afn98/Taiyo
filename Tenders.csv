1,Invitation to tender for creation of a Skatepark for wheeled sports,Evercreech Parish Council,"Evercreech Parish Council (the 'Council') owns the site known as the Village Sports Field in Weston Town and shares responsibility for the management of the playing field and facilities with the local sports club that utilise and organise sports for the benefit of residents. Part of the space was designated as a Skate Park which was initially installed in 1999. This skate part was removed in 2020 for safety reasons.
Following public consultation, the Council created a Plan to replace the facilities, with an identical design but with improvements to make the facility more practical and easier to maintain.
This project seeks to create a skatepark for wheeled sports on the previous site and base.
A tarmacadam base , approximately 30m x 12m, will be re- used. The area is on a flat open ground. We want to include a youth shelter in the vicinity of the skate park - it would be beneficial if this could be incorporated into the design, but not essential. Community engagement has been undertaken with local users and their parents, both scooter users and skate boarders to find out what features they regard as being essential/desirable from a good skate park. These findings have been built into this tender document. Our objective is to create a space for wheeled sports that will offer young people access to as wide a range of opportunities as possible. The space should be visually appealing, exciting, challenging and stimulating. It is planned for the skatepark to be completed and opened by Summer 2023 funds being in place.
We are now seeking tenders for the design and provision of a new skate park from suitably experienced and qualified contractors. The Council has agreed a budget of up to £75,000 ex VAT for the project. All pricing should be exclusive of VAT and in GBP (£). Pricing should be valid for a minimum of 12 months from the date of the tender deadline. Prices will be fixed for the duration of the contract. It should be noted that all of the necessary funds are not currently in place and it will be necessary for the Council to seek additional funding. The council may decide following a review of the tenders to commence work in phases (eg separating the shelter from the skate park)
The Contractor shall make themselves fully conversant with the Council's requirements by reading the invitation to tender and visiting and inspecting the site set out in the tender document.
The Contractor is required to raise any issues on which they require clarification prior to submission of their tender.
It is the responsibility of the tenderer to obtain for themselves, at their own expense, any additional information necessary for the preparation of their tender.
There will be the opportunity to attend a site meeting. Appointments can be booked via rfo@evercreech-pc.gov.uk
Contractors should inform us of their intent to submit a tender by email to rfo@evercreech-pc.gov.uk",Opportunity,,"Recreational, cultural and sporting services - 92000000",BA4 6PE,"£75,000",Evercreech1,14-Sep-22,15-Oct-22,12pm, 1 December 2022, 1 July 2023,Supply contract,Open procedure (below threshold),Yes,No,Julie Ferguson,"Evercreech Parish Council, Evercreech House, Evercreech, BA4 6HZ, England",07783 475200,rfo@evercreech-pc.gov.uk,https://www.evercreech-pc.gov.uk ,,,,

The original programme to develop the current suite of guidance ran between 2012 and 2018 but since the programmes closure, several high-profile incidents have occurred, and various initiatives have been introduced. Although elements of National Operational Guidance are continually reviewed and maintained to ensure outputs/learning from these incidents/initiatives are fed in, this will be the first time National Operational Guidance has been reviewed in its entirety.

The consultant will be responsible for undertaking a thorough and systematic review of National Operational Guidance to determine whether it continues to meet current and future needs of the UK fire and rescue service. 

Using a range of research-based methods and techniques, the consultant will need to engage a wide cross section of stakeholders from end-users through to Chief Fire Officers, to understand how National Operational Guidance is used and determine the effectiveness of the current delivery model, including its governance arrangements. 

Upon completion, the consultant will be required to report and present their findings and recommendations to the NFCC's Senior Leadership Team.

The programme has sought to develop UK capability in EO instrumentation by: providing and overseeing the delivery of match-funded grants; providing strategic, business and technical advice to project teams, the wider EO sector and UK government; and promoting close working relationships and knowledge transfer between the academic community and industry.

Since its inception, the programme has been delivered by the Centre for Earth Observation Instrumentation (CEOI), a consortium of EO experts which has run 14 funding calls to date.An evaluation of the latest phase of the programme concluded in May 2022 and helped to successfully make the case for further programme funding.

UKSA are now preparing to undertake a competitive re-tendering process to deliver the next phase of the programme. The next contract will provide continuity of the programme, whilst also providing an option to scale up the programme, should further funding become available as a result of ongoing National Space Strategy implementation planning.

The successful supplier will be responsible for a small number of ongoing projects, in addition to managing new funding calls, organising events, and providing expert advice to the UK Space Agency through the Added Value programme.

The  information gathered through this Request for Information (RFI) will support the ongoing development of the EOIP requirements.

94,BHE MCZ Acoustic Survey,Natural England,"*Responses by email only*

BHE MCZ was designated in 2019 under the MCAA (2009) and covers an area of 19,486.51 ha between Beachy Head lighthouse in the west and Haistings Pier in the east. The MCZ extends just beyond 6nm offshore. 

Since designation, it has been increasingly clear that, although evidence was sufficient to designate features within the site itself, it is not sufficiently comprehensive to undertake a condition assessment of the features of the site. It is also not currently possible to accurately assess the impacts of certain activities due to uncertainty over the extent of feature habitats. 

Therefore, to ensure site features are protected, conservation advice for the site is precautionary (as required under the Marine and Coastal Access Act (2009).  This survey will gather acoustic data on the seabed and bathymetry within the site to enable locations to be identified for further camera work to be undertaken at a later date. The surveys will provide coverage, scale and quality of ecological evidence and analysis will enable a better understanding of the distribution and extent of designated habitat features of the site.

Overall outputs of the approach: 

* Gather acoustic (side scan sonar and bathymetric) data to identify seabed characteristics and relate these to existing mapping of seabed sediments and potential habitats within the agreed sample area.  

* Using previous survey and habitat information and the acoustic survey information gathered, provide a survey report and suggest likely candidates for further video transect and camera work.",Opportunity,14-Sep-22,Survey services - 79311000,South East,"£1,000",BHEMCZ_2022_AS_RFQ,31-Aug-22,16-Sep-22,12pm,20-Sep-22,31-Mar-23,Service contract,Competitive quotation (below threshold),Yes,No,Paula Daglish,"Natural England, 4th Floor, Upper Market Street, Eastleigh House, Eastleigh, SO50 9YN, England",,paula.daglish@naturalengland.org.uk,,,,,

158,North East Area Magnesian Limestone Conceptual Model and Source Protection Zone Updates,Defra Network eTendering Portal,"We are looking for one contractor to complete work for the following two, overlapping projects:
1.	NE Area Magnesian Limestone Conceptual Model (MLCM) Report update
The MLCM report was originally produced by ESI Ltd consultants in 2009 and comprises of a main document, numerous appendices and a number of GIS shapefiles.  The report focuses on the Permian Magnesian Limestone aquifer located in the Environment Agency's North East (NE) Area.  The aquifer extends from South Shields in the North to Hartlepool in east and Darlington in the west. 
Since 2019 much work has been carried out by the Agency and partners, with improved knowledge of the aquifer gained therefore an updated conceptual model is required in order to consolidate and synthesise this updated understanding.  Work to update the document commenced in 2020 however there was insufficient resource to complete the work in house therefore only a few sections were updated, focussing mainly on the hydrology of the aquifer and water company abstractions.  Further work is required to complete an update to the conceptual model, consolidating and summarising recent understanding and ensuring all sections of the report are up to date.
2.	NE Area Groundwater Source Projection Zones (SPZs) update
Groundwater Source Protection Zones (SPZs) are areas of groundwater where there is a particular sensitivity to pollution risks due to the closeness of a drinking water source and how the groundwater flows.  They are used to protect abstractions used for public water supply and other forms of distribution to the public such as mineral and bottled water plants, breweries and food production plants.  
Existing SPZs are designated across the Magnesian Limestone, Fell Sandstone and Millstone Grit/Coal Measures (Morpeth) aquifers within with the EA's NE Area.  The majority of the existing SPZs were hand drawn in the 1990s, with only the Morpeth zones being completed at a later date in 2005.  The conceptual understanding of the areas aquifers has changed and improved vastly over the past 20-30 years and the water environment is very different.  As such, the existing zones may be significantly out of date and need reviewing and updating, where necessary.  
The EA is looking to procure an external contractor to deliver the work required to review and update both the MLCM report and all SPZs within NE Area. The outputs of the work will aid internal EA staff carry out various regulatory functions and help internal and external understanding of North East aquifers.
The objectives of the work are:
-	To review, update and finalise the Magnesian Limestone Conceptual Model Report for North East Area - bringing the existing conceptual model up to date with current and updated data, literature and understanding.

-	To review and amend and create new groundwater Source Protection Zones for potable supplies in North East Area, across all aquifers.",Opportunity,13-Sep-22,Design-modelling services - 72242000,Any region,£0,tender_314281/1099443,19-Aug-22,21-Sep-22, 5pm, 3 October 2022,30-Jun-23,Service contract,Open procedure (below threshold),Yes,Yes,XX XX,"17 Nobel House, London, SW1P 3JR, England",,procurement@defra.gov.uk,www.defra.bravosolution.co.uk ,,,,

Where there are expressions of interest from one supplier or more, then the framework will be re-opened to allow suppliers who have expressed an interest during the above period to apply to become members.
Related to Project DN454600 Framework to Provide Short Breaks for Children who are Disabled from April 2020 originally tendered 10th January 2020. Publication OJS Number: 2020/S 081-192474 Contract Finder Notice Reference: DORST001-DN454600-05067034
We are looking to reopen and expand our Short Break Provider framework (set up in 2020) to extend the number of suitable service providers offering a range of varied short break opportunities for children, young people and their carers across Dorset.
Short Breaks for Children, Young People and Young Adults who are Disabled are focused on delivering and developing services for 0 - 25-year-olds.
This tender is about putting in place a range of Targeted and Specialist Short Break opportunities throughout the County (Dorset).
Short breaks are when a child or young person has planned time apart from their main carer outside school hours, taking part in activities they like, to form and develop friendships and become more confident and independent. Short Breaks allow the child's family to have a break from the demands of caring, to relax and recharge their batteries, to spend time with each other and their other children and to reduce family stress. Short Breaks can take place in a community location, the child's own home, the home of an approved short break carer, or in a residential setting.
Reliability of the provision and support is essential in order that a family can plan ahead. The framework is divided into the two categories detailed below:
CATEGORY A: Specialist Services - This is likely to include, but is not limited to, the following: 
- Residential overnight short breaks 
- Weekend, after school and holiday short break sessions 
- Personal Assistant, in-home and community support work

CATEGORY B: Targeted Services - Services required are likely to include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Outreach one to one services including befriending/buddy/PA schemes (at home or in the community)
- After school, holiday and weekend play, sports and activity sessions for all ages - Activity, day and evening sessions for young people aged 15-18 and/or 18 - 25

To express your interest in applying for the framework to provide short breaks for children who are disabled from April 2023, please email childrensservicescontracts@dorsetcouncil.gov.uk by no later than Tuesday 18th October 2022 at 16.00 at which point this expression of interest period will close.

The Oxfordshire model has three key elements within the overall programme :

1.	Developing the individual diagnostic pathways that will develop the new Integrated Community Mental Health Pathway 
2.	Developing the Primary Care Mental Health teams in localities.
3.	Developing the Primary Care Mental Health Practitioners ( ARRS) teams 

Oxford Health (OHFT) wants to evaluate these projects as the model being implemented is innovative and transformative, focusing on a trauma-informed, holistic approach to care rather than more traditional clinical models. OHFT seeks to understand how the impact of this service model varies from more traditional models in addition to meeting previously unmet need, and the impact this has had on people's lives and recovery. 

OHFT would like to understand and also evidence a good return on investment, including in comparison to alternative service models employed elsewhere. It is important that this analysis focuses on and articulates the individual impact of specific types of roles as part of a blended model as well as service outcomes as a whole. Given staffing challenges across the NHS and mental health services in particular, every employment has a high opportunity cost, and it is important for OHFT to be able to justify this and to develop an evidence base for the efficacy of the service model. 

The evaluation must include baseline analysis (prior to any changes being implemented) to enable a useful contrast with the current state of operation.

290,Mixing Equipment for UKBIC Flexible Industrialisation Line (FIL),UK Battery Industrialisation Centre,"UKBIC has a requirement to purchase a range of equipment relating to the manufacture of battery electrodes to establish a Flexible Industrialisation Line (FIL) at the UK Battery Industrialisation Centre.

The UK Battery Industrialisation Centre (UKBIC) is part of the UK Government's Faraday Battery Challenge. UKBIC is a national battery manufacturing development facility helping to scale-up battery manufacturing and facilitate upskilling in the battery sector. We are a publicly funded, open access facility, funded by the Faraday Battery Challenge at UK Research and Innovation (UKRI).

This PIN lists the general requirements for anode and cathode slurry mixing equipment to be housed in a clean and dry room for a battery electrode Flexible Industrialisation Line (FIL) at UKBIC.


Vendors will be invited to submit a bid to provide a flexible mixing system to fit into a clean and dryroom. This system would need to be representative and scale-able to a larger system

For the mixing process of the anode and cathode materials to form a coatable electrode slurry, the necessary equipment must be procured;

In the first step, the materials (liquids and solids) of the electrode slurries must be dosed to the mixing system from storage containers. The materials are subdivided into active materials (e.g. graphite, lithium metal oxide etc. - typically in the form of micron scale powders), conductive agent, binder, additives, solvents etc.

The target of the process is the production of a homogeneous electrode coatable slurry. Agglomerates or contamination of the slurry with foreign particles (especially metallic particles, air bubbles) must be excluded. Mixing is precursor step for coating and drying. The supplier must ensure that his system can be linked to the coating and drying line, or that slurry can be transferred to the coater.

• The mixer must be capable of both Anode and Cathode slurries, therefore the supplier must provide a thorough cleaning strategy for the system.

• Vendors are invited to submit equipment solutions to provide a mixing capability for minimum 25L to 70L per batch, mixing can be a batch or comparable continuous process.

• The equipment needs to operate between ambient conditions to -70°C dewpoint.

• The mixing equipment must be capable of producing homogenous, gas free electrode slurries suitable for slot-die coating on conventional coating and drying equipment.

• The mixing system must have the capability for inerting and provision of dry nitrogen or dry argon blanketing or vacuum system.

• The equipment must offer modular solution, so equipment can be easily reconfigured or decommissioned in the future.

• The equipment must be capable of producing different recipes and formulations and mixing protocols.

One mixing system must be procured - if budget allows, a second mixing system may be procured to avoid cross-contamination.

The LPA are keen on promoting PPAs as a way of ensuring high quality applications are submitted and that appropriate resource and expertise can be dedicated to supporting both pre-application discussions and the formal assessment stage.  The LPA is, however, currently experiencing difficulties in recruiting planners with sufficient experience to manage the complex and challenging work associated with schemes proceeding under a PPA, meaning that creative solutions to identified problems and proactive engagement with the correct stakeholders is delayed, particularly at the formal assessment stage. 

The LPA is therefore looking to establish a framework of experienced planning consultants to help manage and deliver on the PPA's that it enters into. From this framework, the LPA in consultation with the applicant would select a consultant or consultancy who would provide a time limited service to the LPA to progress the development proposals concerned and manage the PPA, delivering the necessary outputs under the agreed scope of the PPA and in accordance with its milestones.

The goal is to enable retailers and food service businesses to measure and report the proportion of their UK sourced food stemming from supply chains/producers participating in ""Robust Environmental Schemes"". Robust environmental schemes is the proxy in the WWF Basket Metric for the conservation of biodiversity and soil health in their food. This project will define what combinations of private and public schemes relating to food production are 'environmentally robust' and provide a tool for ongoing assessment of such schemes. By aggregating farm-level data on scheme participation through the supply chain, businesses will be able to set out the how much of the food they buy/sell robustly contributes to biodiversity and soil health goals. It will also contribute to the definition of environmental aspects of 'better meat'. 

The core of this consultancy will therefore be: 

To define ""Robust Environmental Schemes"": the environmental outcomes that farm schemes need to specify and assure in order to be considered, wholly or in part, a ""Robust Environmental Scheme"". 

To assess the degree to which existing agricultural certification and incentive schemes assure the delivery of environmental outcomes, especially for biodiversity and soil health, with reference to the Robust Environmental Scheme definition. 

To generate a tool demonstrating the assessment above for ongoing use, development and review. 

To set out the means for identification of the amount of food production that comes from farms meeting the definition of being in 'Robust Environmental Schemes', such that they themselves and/or food businesses can report this. 

To generate outputs tailored to the audiences relevant to the project.

411,GB-Scotland: Coaching & Mentoring Software,Scottish Water,"Scottish Water is seeking to procure a Saas coaching and mentoring programme which will create a platform to support learning and talent development for Scottish Water leaders and employees. The platform will also support and enable more effective and efficient matching, scheduling and goal setting and with the ability to track and analyse benefits and results.   

       Scottish Water are actively looking to increase peer to peer learning and one way we are doing this is through coaching and mentoring. We will see an increase on the demand for coaching and mentoring when we put greater emphasis on the importance of this, making it more difficult to manage it manually. Having a system will enable us to grow in this area, sharing skills and expertise across the organisation and enabling colleagues to seek out a mentor or coach without manual intervention from the People Directorate in most cases. 

      Our Goals 

      Increase our sense of 'leadership community' through leaders supporting leaders 

      Support new leaders by increasing their confidence to lead change and transformation 

      Increase the visibility and availability of social learning opportunities 

      Support career growth and transfer experience though coaching and mentoring 

      Increase the scale and effectiveness of reverse mentoring 

      Provide structured coaching and mentoring support to diverse groups of employees 

      Support employee wellbeing through coaching from our wellbeing champions 

      Support the retention and development of high potential and specialist employees 

      Demonstrate the ROI and business results that can be achieved through coaching and mentoring 

      4 key areas should be targeted to digitally transform the way coaching & mentoring are delivered, address the issues with the current arrangements and achieve the ambition. These areas are: 

      Digitalisation - move from the current manual process to a digital solution that would support and track coaching/mentoring activity. 

      Targeted skillsets - move to a managed digital solution to allow specific skillsets and requirements to be matched up to the best placed person within the system. This will enable users to develop in their desired area that will then allow them to progress their career within SW.  

      Enhanced Support - move to a structured process for coaching and mentoring, guided by the system with the ability to interact socially with others providing a sense of community and keep records of progress. 

      Insights - move from the ad-hoc manual collection of coaching and mentoring data to a systemised digital process-driven approach which enables evaluation.

428,Future skills projections and analysis - review and assessment of leading and emerging methodologies,Department For Education,"The Unit for Future Skills (UFS) is an analytical and research unit within the Department for Education. It has been set up to improve the quality of jobs and skills data, working across government to make it available and more accessible to policy makers, stakeholders, and the general public. 
Skills and training decisions need to consider not only the current skills needs, but future developments. However, analysis of future skills needs is carried out with varying levels of coordination and quality depending on the area of the economy and the body carrying out that analysis. 
The aim of this project is to review and assess leading and emerging methodologies for analysis of future skills needs. This will help prepare the UFS to become a centre of expertise on future skills supporting other actors (such as employers) to carry-out more robust and reliable analysis. There are three main types of analysis to include: 
•	Type 1: Economy-wide skills projections or forecasts that are consistent with the overall economic outlook (growth and employment). For example, testing whether it is possible to improve on existing approaches, such as Working Futures' projections of employment by occupation. 
•	Type 2: Analysis of future skills needs for a specific segment of the economy, which may not necessarily be consistent with the overall economic outlook. This is typically carried out for specific sectors or in relation to a specific new technology. 
•	Type 3: Ways of reconciling or validating analysis type 2 with type 1 so that it is more consistent and reliable when compared against the overall economic outlook.

448,Nitrogen and phosphorus excretion calculator tool for pigs and poultry,DEPARTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENT FOOD & RURAL AFFAIRS,"""The Environment Agency regulates and advises on various aspects of the agriculture sector including large-scale intensive pig and poultry units through the Environmental Permitting Regulations. Environmental permits are required for farms with more than 40,000 poultry places, more than 2,000 production pig places or more than 750 sow places. This regulatory regime ensures that emissions from these activities do not have an unacceptable impact on nearby protected habitat sites, nor contribute excessively to the national inventory of emissions.  

Permitted farms are required to meet the Best Available Techniques (BAT) Conclusions for the Intensive Rearing of Poultry or Pigs (IRPP) sector. The latest version of this document was published in 2017 (available here) and sets out new requirements to monitor and report emissions from permitted farms for comparison with the BAT-associated levels. This included a requirement for all operators to report emissions of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) excreted in livestock manures on an annual basis. This project links to this BAT requirement to report N and P emissions and the need for additional support for operators to enable accurate calculations of livestock N and P emissions in livestock manures.

The implementation of the 2017 Best Available Techniques (BAT) conclusions for the IRPP sector required operators to monitor total nitrogen (N) and total phosphate (P) excreted in livestock manures and report these emissions on an annual basis. The BAT associated excretion level is expressed as Kg N or P2O5 excreted/animal place/year. The BAT conclusions provide two available techniques for measuring N and P emissions in livestock manures; one being manure analysis and the other being calculation by using a mass balance of nitrogen and phosphorus based on feed intake, crude protein and total phosphorus content of the diet, and animal performance.  

We are seeking specialist technical knowledge to understand the most appropriate calculation method based on the mass balance technique highlighted in the BAT conclusions and develop a simple tool.  The purpose of this project is to develop a simple calculator tool to assist operators with the calculation of N and P excretion to enable them to accurately report these emissions to the Environment Agency for compliance checks against the BAT-associated total N/P excretion levels.

458,Developing a UK Skills Taxonomy,Department For Education,"At present, there is no UK-specific skills taxonomy encompassing skills, qualifications, and occupations (and the mappings between them).  Different stakeholders use different taxonomies, some developed using novel approaches and others based on existing taxonomies developed in other countries (ESCO - Europe, O*NET - US) which aren't necessarily suitable for the UK labour market. Consequently, the language used to describe labour market information (LMI) is inconsistent, making it difficult to identify the demand for and supply of skills and mismatches between the two. 

The Unit for Future Skills within the Department for Education, is seeking to establish a UK-specific taxonomy that will enable the department (and government more widely) to better organise and describe LMI and extract greater insights from it. This will greatly improve our understanding of what jobs require which skills, and which qualifications provide different skills. This in turn will help identify skills mismatches, allowing policy makers, education providers, employers etc to respond appropriately. 

The project will be comprised of two phases. Phase 1 will focus on developing use cases through stakeholder engagement, scoping out the details of any proposed methodology (or methodologies) - including the benefits and drawbacks of the proposed approach(es) - and developing a detailed workplan for the development of a UK skills taxonomy. Phase 2 will focus on the actual development of the taxonomy, alongside a programme of user testing. There will be a review point at the end of phase 1 to evaluate outputs for quality and feasibility and decide whether the department will proceed with phase 2 of the project.

Bidders will need to demonstrate expertise in the subject matter area and a knowledge of the UK education system. Project management skills for a work programme spanning multiple years, and adequate resource to undertake and deliver a large-scale project are also essential. They will also need demonstrate evidence of wide-ranging research and analytical skills (e.g. quantitative, qualitative, data analytics) and the ability to produce high quality analysis to pre-agreed timelines. 

Please note that £50,000 is for Phase 1 - there is additional budget for Phase 2

As a result, Her Majesty's Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS) is now seeking to develop its academy delivery model within prison work and learning environments and is seeking to do so in partnership with more employers to deliver sector specific skills training to meet the changing needs of the economy and smooth the path from prison to employment.

We know that having a job to go to on release from prison can significantly reduce the chance of reoffending and employers can benefit from securing committed and skilled people to fill gaps in the UK economy.

HMP Academies are workspaces hosted by employers that have a clear emphasis on providing specialist vocational training and offer the prisoners participating in them significant skills development and employment opportunities that can significantly impact reducing re-offending rates. Whilst there are a small number already established in prisons, we want to do much more. 

To achieve this, we are seeking to procure additional HMP Academies hosted by employers by engaging with a diverse range of businesses from across all sectors that can offer prisoners a second chance

472,HMS Victory Timber Supply Framework ITT,THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE ROYAL NAVY,"HMS Victory Timber Supply Framework ITT

Overview 

Over the next 12 years, the National Museum of the Royal Navy (NMRN) are leading the conservation of HMS Victory to ensure the long-term preservation of a world-class historic vessel and an exemplar of a Royal Navy capital warship from the Age of Sail.

In addition to being a unique historic asset, HMS Victory continues to be a significant visitor attraction within Portsmouth Historic Dockyard whilst continuing to serve as a commissioned warship of the Royal Navy.

The conservation work includes the replacement of all external and some internal planking in a staged programme; it is intended that the ship remains open to the public throughout the planned work. The work will be carried out inside an encapsulated conservation scaffold which will allow the NMRN's Shipwrights to remove and replace the hull planks. Core to the programme is the procurement of Timber, primarily Oak, to meet the planned Hull Conservation programme. 

In addition to planking, additional solid 'curved' timber will be needed to replace items such as knees and beams (compass timber), and the timber supplier(s) will be invited to work with the NMRN to source and produce such items. The NMRN have been engaged in dialogue with suppliers in the timber market prior to this tender notice, with a Market Engagement Day and one-to-one dialogue meetings. These sessions have been vital to engage with a collaborative approach with suppliers to meet the specifications required for the supply of timber for HMS Victory. 

Tenderers will be invited to submit their tender response for a Framework Agreement for initial 4 years (full details can be found in Annex C) based on three separate Lots, this can be done for individual lots or all lots.  

Notice for Suppliers-
Please refer to Annex A Scope of Requirement and Annex F for detail of the breakdown of the timber specification, including the planking schedule.

The price for this tender of £3,000,000 is the provisional budget for the first two years of this project, based on (at the time) market prices from dialogue with suppliers during the PIN Notice period.

The contract length of 5 years is the length of the Framework Agreement.

We would like advice from our chosen suppler as to the level of detail in which we may be able to build our systems model or map considering our timeframe and budget (whether this is at a programme level, project level or issue specific level).  The model will need to be accessible to facilitate participation within the Environment Agency and potentially with partners in the first stage to prove the concept and approach. Due to the context of our partnership approach and appetite for participative decision making we envisage a process of confidence building with the main delivery organisations. We are committed to facilitating wider participation but there are recognised challenges around information sharing in the nuclear sector due to security concerns for example. For this reason, we expect to be taking an evolutionary approach. The model will need to be suitable for adaptation to support wider civil society and citizen participation in the future.  
  
We remain flexible on our approach to this work and would work together with our chosen supplier on the best approach to undertake participative systems mapping. We are however expecting a phased approach that includes some limited participation that will form the basis for further deliberation and refinement at a later stage.

508,Systematic Data Analysis Exploring 'Better' Protein,WWF-UK (WORLD WIDE FUND FOR NATURE) TRADING LIMITED,"Background  

Our dietary choices are driving a system of food production that is destroying the planet; global meat consumption went up by 350% between 1961 and 2013 (and is projected to increase by another 50% by 2050)2, with livestock production contributing to almost a third of the total emissions and covering 82% of land used for food production3. Within this context it is becoming more and more urgent to understand what sustainable protein is, focusing on 'better' animal and plant protein.  

Main purpose and scope 

In order to support a shift to 'less and better', we need to understand what, where and how to produce animal and plant protein. This requires access to and the availability of accurate, granular and credible protein data - however, this data doesn't currently exist in adequate quantity or quality. We need to be able to use aligned metrics and standardised data stored in a harmonised format to explore what should be produced, under which production systems, in which geographies; and explore local/national/regional/global comparative advantage to guide domestic production as well as trade.  



The aim of this project is to conduct a systematic data analysis to understand routes to 'better' protein sources by delivering research that:  

Identifies the availability of and gaps in necessary protein data;  

Supports the expansion of infrastructure to capture and access consistent data5;  

Explores how impacts differ within food groups according to location and method of production​.

509,ASC0283 - Individual Placement and Support (IPS) in Community Drug and Alcohol Treatment,Leicester City Council,"Leicester City Council invites Tenders from suitably qualified and experienced organisations for the provision of an Individual Placement and Support in Community Drug and Alcohol Treatment programme.

Leicester City Council has been chosen as one of the areas for the roll out of Individual Placement Support (IPS) for substance misuse.  Funding has been allocated to Leicester by central government for the 2022-25 period based on the costs of employing 2 employment advisors and 1 senior employment advisor.

IPS is a well-evidenced approach, primarily used to-date in Mental Health services, that should be available for anyone of working age in structured drug/alcohol treatment. Services should be tailored to individual needs, co-located within substance misuse services and providing pre-employment and in-work support. 

Two key aspects of the approach are, firstly, that the employment advisors should be working alongside substance misuse staff as part of and an equal member of the multi-disciplinary team, establishing employment as a key aim of recovery. Secondly IPS is seen as a 'work first' intervention helping people into jobs that they want to do regardless of their stage on the recovery journey. 
The proposed Contract shall be held by Leicester City Council and will be for an initial period of 2 years to commence on 1st February 2023 to 31st March 2025, with an option to extend, subject to continued funding and satisfactory performance outcomes for a further 3 years to 31st March 2028, taking the contract term to a maximum of 5 years. 

The proposed service is based on current and known funding allocations. These could alter through the life of the contract in light of changes in future local and central government funding. The earmarked funding for 2023 to 2025 is £335,010.  If funding were to be sustained beyond this period the contract value could be £807,306.

525,Market Engagement Event - NHS MSE ICB - Primary Care Multi-lot APMS Procurement (Thurrock and Southend),Attain,"There are five time-limited APMS GP contracts and one fixed term GMS Contract in Mid & South Essex that are due to expire on 31 March and 30 June 2023. The practices deliver primary medical services to a combined registered actual patient population of 54,972 (as at 1 April 2022).  

NHS MSE ICB is seeking input from interested organisations to take part in a pre-procurement Market Engagement Event in relation to the re-procurement of each of these contracts, which will be held virtually as a webinar and broadcast via Microsoft (MS) Teams. The format of the event will be a presentation from the commissioners followed by a Q&A.  The information gathered will inform the approach to the procurement process.

The ICB has determined that there is a need for services to remain at the existing sites and therefore in order to ensure that there is no interruption to patients' continuity of care and access requirements, and is therefore undertaking a single one-stage procurement under the Light Touch Regime for all six contracts, with each acting as a separate and individual 'lot' and subsequent contract, to enable the mobilisation of a new provider from 1 April 2023 for five of the contracts, and 1st July 2023 for one of the contracts.

Lot 1 - Y00999 - Oddfellows Health Centre & St Clements Health Centre - actual list of 11,800 as at 1st April 2022
Lot 2 - F81110 - Tilbury Health Centre - actual list of 12,178 as at 1st April 2022
Lot 3 - Y02807 - Thurrock Health Centre - actual list of 12,502 as at 1st April 2022
Lot 4 - F81206 - Commonwealth Health Centre - actual list of 5,740 as at 1st April 2022
Lot 5 - Y00033 - Purfleet Care Centre - actual list of 6,358 as at 1st April 2022
Lot 6 - F81684 - North Shoebury Surgery - actual list of 6,394 as at 1st April 2022

The ICB is procuring all six lots as APMS contracts due to the time limited nature of them and flexibilities that they permit in terms of bidding audience e.g. whole of the market and the ability to agree the reporting schedules enabling KPIs that support delivery of the Long-term Plan and facilitates and enables the development of ""at scale"" provision through the PCN model of delivery. In line with the strategic aims for Mid & South Essex ICB, the system is committed to deliver primary care on a standard contract term to allow for delivery at scale and innovation by offering longer term arrangements.  

It is proposed that each contract will be awarded for a period of 15 years; Lots 1 to 4 and Lot 6 from 01/04/23 - 31/03/38, and Lot 5 from 01/07/23  - 31/03/38.

535,COV - Strategic Energy Partner,Coventry City Council (COV),"The Council recognises the role it must play in mitigating and adapting to the Climate Emergency, as a key influencer and policy maker. It also has a key role in delivering economic growth in the city and tackling inequalities. All three areas make up strands of the One Coventry plan. Providing the right energy infrastructure across the city is critical to all three of these strands. A strategic outlook on energy infrastructure will support and enable delivery of what is identified as needed.

      What is also recognised are the constraints in delivering this strategic outlook and infrastructure development, in resources, expertise, project delivery and routes to funding. 

      Therefore, it is anticipated that an Energy Partner would sit alongside the Council in a long-term contractual joint venture relationship to deliver the following objectives:

      o To contribute to and influence the review of energy needs in the city (also in relation to impact upon climate change and carbon emissions reduction), and how these may be achieved with discrete or strategic projects (including community, residential, commercial and industrial developments).
      o To assist with the authoring of the energy infrastructure strategy (which complements completely the broader Sustainability & Climate Change strategy)
      o To identify projects or initiatives that will deliver the strategy and complete the corresponding business case(s) to support implementation of these projects.
      o Apply resource across a project or initiative lifecycle to deliver the required outcomes, or attract further third party resource and input to deliver the same (sub-contracting)
      o To fund via debt or equity, or to assist in third party fund raising, to deliver projects or initiatives
      o To identify opportunities for viable commercial enterprise and income generation which assists to secure additional resources to re-invest in developing energy infrastructure and services and meet environmental standards required by developers and investors now and in the future.
      o To be the Councils operating partner or to oversee other operational models for each of the projects or initiatives as they are delivered.
      o To provide the appropriate level of stakeholder engagement/consultation activity required in the design and delivery of business case(s) and projects.
      o To embed social value within the strategic outlook, business case(s) and delivery approach and ensures that outputs/outcomes can be clearly measured.

      The following outcomes have been identified by internal stakeholders as priorities for delivering the One Coventry Plan. This is not an exhaustive list as CCC will work with the Strategic Partner to develop and refine the intended outcomes of the project. The Partner will be encouraged to challenge and add to the intended outcomes.

      o Enable zero carbon, energy efficient, resilient and adaptable buildings across the city

554,Domiciliary Care AQP-Hertfordshire and West Essex ICB,EVALUCOM CONSULTING LTD,"Hertfordshire and West Essex ICB are inviting care providers to join us in shaping a new approach to the way we commission Domiciliary Care across our area.

We want to deliver better outcomes for the ICS, for care providers and for individuals in receipt of care through a standardised service specification and procurement process.

Over the coming months we will work with our care providers and other local partners to co-develop a bespoke service specification for a new Domiciliary Care Any Qualified Provider (AQP) framework.

Your involvement will help us to develop a service specification that builds on your experience and reflects your understanding of what is required to support care providers and individuals in receipt of care.

We will run a procurement process at the end of the year based on this new specification and would, welcome your participation. 

We intend for the Domiciliary Care AQP to go-live next summer.

Hertfordshire and West Essex ICB have commissioned Evalucom to implement the Domiciliary Care AQP.

We will host an online Q&A session to give you further information about our plans and give you the opportunity to ask us questions. This will take place on Wednesday 28 September 2022 at 1pm. Please email the team at HWE.DomCareAQP@evalucom.co.uk to register a place. 

We will send updates by email. If you want to add an alternative contact to our mailing list, please send an email to the team at: HWE.DomCareAQP@evalucom.co.uk. Please include your name, your role and details of your domiciliary care organisation.

564,Research into measuring and valuing the environmental impacts of chemical pollution in the UK,Defra Network eTendering Portal,"Background
The UK has longstanding and comprehensive regulatory and monitoring regimes for priority chemicals in the environment, meanwhile research programmes both domestically and internationally have furthered human understanding of the potential harms caused by exposure to specific chemicals or groups of chemicals. The stock of existing chemicals that have not yet made their way into the environment and the development of new chemicals for use in processes and products are increasing rapidly and there is a need to better understand the overall effects and costs of damage from exposure. This is key to justifying action and determining the appropriate controls for effectively managing the risks they pose. If not managed appropriately, some chemicals can disrupt the populations of plants, animals, fungi and microorganisms in ways that can lead to ecological change.
Aim
To develop a methodology to measure and quantify the environmental impacts of chemical pollutants in the context of chemicals regulation within the UK. The avoided environmental damage costs from regulation can then be compared against the cost of controls.
Objectives
The objectives of this project are to: 
1.	To scope and develop a conceptual framework and methodology to measure and predict the effects of chemical pollutants on the environment. The impacts of these effects on the environment will need to be quantified and, ideally, monetised. 
2.	Develop methods which assess the differences in effects amongst chemical pollutants, which will support risk management and benefits monetisation of regulation.",Opportunity,,Research and development services and related consultancy services - 73000000,London,£0,tender_314481/1104414, 7 September 2022,14-Oct-22,12pm,27-Oct-22,22-Mar-24,Service contract,Open procedure (below threshold),Yes,Yes,Defra,"17 Nobel House, London, SW1P 3JR, England",0,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ,,,,

Newham has HIV prevalence of 5.44 per 1000 population and is ranked 14 in London. 34.5% of cases are diagnosed late in Newham. We commissioned HIV screening in General Practices to increase testing and improve detection and earlier diagnosis. All General Practices in Newham are signed up to the delivery of Public Health services including HIV screening for newly registered and high risk residents of Newham.

Previously, HIV antibody testing was provided through saliva samples from oral swabs or standard venous blood sampling. However in May 2020 the oral swabs were decommissioned as they did not carry the 'CE' certification. We are keen to understand if there are any providers of HIV oral swab kits in the market. We are also looking for alternative option for e.g. Point of Care (POC) test which requires minimal blood, removes the local provider needing to give results at the point of testing and possibly have the potential to add on another Blood borne Virus (BBV) screening at the same time.

567,Net Zero Delivery Tracker Analysis,WWF-UK (WORLD WIDE FUND FOR NATURE) TRADING LIMITED,"Background 
Over the course of 2020-21, WWF-UK developed a full Net Zero Delivery Tracker (previously 
referred to as Net Zero Test) methodology, which enables assessment, at each Budget or 
Spending Review of:      
a) Total positive, negative and neutral spending in relation to priority environmental 
areas 
b) The carbon emissions impact of the overall fiscal event 
c) The extent to which this emissions impact is compatible with a stated emissions 
pathway to net zero 

Output 
Full Net Zero Delivery Tracker analysis of the UK Government's Autumn 2022 Budget 
(whether this is undertaken to standard timeframes or expedited as an emergency budget). 
This will involve applying the previously developed Net Zero Delivery Tracker methodology 
to the fiscal package, conducting budget tagging and emissions estimate modelling. Due to 
the nature of the fiscal package, new approaches to emissions estimate modelling may be 
required for individual line items. 
As an example of the expected output, please see this report based on applying the Net 
Zero Delivery Tracker to the Autumn 2021 Budget and Comprehensive Spending Review. 

Deliverables 
• Engagement with WWF-UK's work on Net Zero Delivery Tracker until now, including 
all Excel-based analysis 
• Attendance at full-day knowledge transfer workshop with technical experts who 
previously worked on the modelling 
• Budget tagging analysis and emissions modelling of Budget, presented in accessible 
report format, along with delivery of underpinning analysis 

Required expertise 
Experienced economist or team of economists with strong quantitative modelling expertise 
and some experience of undertaking economic modelling in an environmental context, 
preferably including use of emissions estimates.  
Ability to thoroughly absorb and understand principles and modelling approach of Net Zero 
Delivery Tracker and adapt it to new budget items, including designing new approaches to 
calculating direct, indirect, and induced impact of tax and spending policies

Brief Description of Requirement

UK Shared Business Services (UK SBS), on behalf of the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI), Medical Research Council (MRC) wishes to establish a Contract for the provision of Legal Services for seven (7) years.

UK SBS is managing this procurement process in accordance with the Public Contracts Regulations 2015 (as may be amended from time to time) (the ""Regulations""). 

Introduction

The Medical Research Council (MRC) currently funds its 21 units via legal agreements (Strategic Alliance Agreements) with the University in which the unit is hosted. These legal agreements cover all aspects of the unit operating model. Outside of this arrangement, 4 units are funded directly by the MRC and are managed by a Director reporting to the MRC Management Board.

The MRC Council has approved proposals to establish a new approach to supporting (funding) the units and these changes represent one of the most significant funding policy shifts in the past decade. The changes to the funding models will be made in consultation with the host University (or Research Organisation) and MRC Directors or their equivalent and will require legal advice to manage changes to funding which will include establishing new units, closing existing units and transitioning units from the current funding model to the new model. The contracted legal team will need to highlight areas of risk, propose risk mitigation and provide legal advice to ensure that contractual changes  and new legal documents and/or award funding clauses are completed in a timely manner, working with other lawyers,  the host University or (Research Organisation) and MRC staff as appropriate.

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Supplier Attachments tab within the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal.

The School Bus Franchises will be tendered in three Franchise Tranches determined by geographical area, as follows:

(i)	The first Schools Franchise Tranche (broadly covering Bolton, Salford and Wigan), is expected to contain 23 schools only franchises, in addition to the two Large Franchises and nine Small Franchises;

(iii)	The third Schools Franchise Tranche (broadly covering Tameside, Stockport, South Manchester and Trafford) is expected to contain around 25 schools only franchises, in addition five Large Franchises plus eight Small Franchises.

640,Supporting Parents to Avoid Recurrent Care Proceedings,Norfolk County Council,"Norfolk County Council is intending to procure a service, to commence April 2023, aimed at supporting vulnerable parents in Norfolk who have experienced care proceedings leading to the removal of children from their care. The procurement will be delivering against Public Health and Children's Social Care priorities with agreed targets and deliverables. The service should be responsive to demand, acknowledging that while the highest levels of need are most likely to be in Norfolk's urban hubs (Norwich, King's Lynn and Great Yarmouth) support will also need to be accessible to service users in more rural areas such as Breckland, South and North Norfolk. There are numerous, complex reasons that can lead to a family experiencing the removal of a child/children and we want to see fewer children coming in to care with fewer parents experiencing the loss associated with children being removed. The delivery partner will need to have a thorough knowledge of, and skilled approaches to address, the range of challenges these parents face; and be able to engage not only with people on an individual basis, but work in a way that sees them integrate with the existing infrastructure of support across our county. The work is likely to be a mix of direct delivery, group work and partnership working; supporting parents to engage with other skilled or specialist services where necessary. The service will need to be committed to supporting vulnerable parents to overcome persistent and enduring challenges, using approaches and techniques that will help them make the incremental changes that lead to significant progress over time. The intention is to let a contract for a period of up to 4-years, working in close partnership with the Local Authority delivering to a specific, eligible group of parents. The maximum potential value across the contract term is likely to be in the region of £1.2m.

Cefas and JNCC undertook a survey of West of Wight Barfleur MCZ (WWBF hereafter) between 22nd and 25th January 2021, cruise code CEND0121.

The aim of the survey was to collect data from WWBF to inform assessment of the condition of the feature attributes (i.e. extent, distribution, structure and function, and supporting processes) of the designated features (broadscale sedimentary habitats). 

Video observations were made with a drop camera (DC) system. The DC was equipped with a high-definition video camera and a separate still image camera unit, in a planar (downwards facing) orientation inside the frame. The stills camera was fitted with a two-spot (green) laser-scaling device with laser points set 220mm apart.

100m length DC transects were carried out at 40 sampling locations based on regular triangular grid (including increased replication transects at a subset of six sampling stations). 

Images from each transect have been pre-selected at random to provide a calculated field of view from ~14m2 to ~24m2 per transect. 1303 images have been selected in total for analysis from WWBF.

701,Athlete Medical Insurance Scheme,THE UNITED KINGDOM SPORTS COUNCIL,"UK Sport's Athlete Medical Scheme (AMS) is a medical insurance scheme which covers the costs of healthcare of funded athletes who are members of Olympic and Paralympic sports World Class Programmes. National Governing Bodies, funded or unfunded, may also purchase places on AMS at an agreed cost by UK Sport, to provide medical cover to athletes not on a World Class Programme.
The mission of the AMS is to drive an efficient and effective athlete medical scheme to develop athlete health and wellbeing. Beneath this mission are three objectives:

1.	Ensure that athletes receive timely and high-quality medical care when needed to bring them back to full health and fitness

2.	Ensure that the AMS scheme is cost and operationally efficient, effective and understood by all stakeholders

3.	Drive the insights from AMS usage to identify opportunities to advance the Athlete Health strategy

To meet these objectives and advance the scheme, UK Sport facilitates and chair a governance group made up of medical leads from within the high-performance system, the incumbent medical insurance provider and insurance brokers, and the AMS Manager. This group meet on a quarterly basis, ensuring good governance of the scheme.

UK Sport pays an annual premium to cover the costs of claims and, subject to approval and conditions of cover by AMS the athlete receives healthcare. It is a free service to athletes and no costs are recharged to their governing bodies. An initial introduction to AMS is set out in the information leaflet at Appendix 1.

The pre-authorisation of claims is conducted by an AMS Manager, employed within the British Olympic Association (BOA) and who is the key liaison for claims with the incumbent insurance provider. The Athlete Medical Scheme Manager will maintain records of pre-authorised claims on the Athlete Medical Scheme system and oversee claims against agreed benefit limits.

AMS is due for renewal with effect from 1 April 2023. UK Sport now invites Tenders for the provision of AMS in accordance with this ITT and the attached documents. UK Sport seeks to enter into a long-term arrangement with a sole insurer supplier for the next 3 years with a possible extension for a further 1 year. UK Sport seek to also insert a break clause after 12 months of the agreement commencing.
As this process is conducted using the open procedure, there is no separate pre-qualification stage or questionnaire.

One in four people in the UK will suffer a mental health problem in the course of a year. Mental illness covers a wide range of conditions such as depression, anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders, through to more severe conditions like schizophrenia.

Common mental disorders (CMD) include conditions such as depression and anxiety. Results from the 2014 Adult Psychiatric Morbidity Survey (APMS) show that 1 in 6 adults had a common mental disorder (CMD) in the week prior to the survey, rising to almost in 1 in 5 adults in London.

Mental ill-health represents a significant burden on our local population and the health and care system. It is estimated that almost 47,600 adults in Southwark are currently experiencing a CMD, this is expected to rise to approximately 52,000 individuals over the next decade

Although less disabling than major psychiatric disorders, the higher prevalence of CMD mean that their cumulative cost to society is greater. All types of CMD are more prevalent in women than among men, and they are also more likely to experience more severe symptoms. Young women were identified as a particularly high-risk group with an estimated 5,600 cases in the borough. Employment and socio-economic status were identified as a substantial risk factor. In Southwark, approximately half of the claims for employment and support allowance (ESA) are related to mental health - with 6,000 cases in February 2016.",Opportunity,,Residential health facilities services - 85144000,London,,PRJ1111, 2 September 2022,19-Sep-22,,,,,,Yes,Yes,Barend Henning,"160 Tooley Street, LONDON, SE1 2TZ, England",7770970400,Barend.henning@nhs.net,https://procontract.due-north.com/Advert?advertId=d7e63c34-e02a-ed11-8119-005056b64545 ,,,,

To evaluate the programme and produce recommendations on the potential expansion of the programme to a wider number of UTCs and further education providers.

HEE believes that it is highly unlikely for any other supplier to be able to provide the following skills/tools provided by Baker Dearing Educational Trust (BDET) for the following reasons:

1.	BDET is the only organisation with the responsibility for supporting and coordinating the work of UTCs, as it was created specifically for this purpose. 
2.	The UTCs are publicly supported by the Department for Education, which has provided transitional funding grants for each of the past five years, totalling £900,000 per UTC.
3.	Work on creating digital health pathways has already started in around 10 UTCs, giving them theoretical and practical experience in this area.
4.	With 48 UTCs across the country, the UTC programme has a critical mass that allows for interventions and improvements to be based on empirical evidence and data.
5.	The UTCs have a number of well-known supporters including Professor Brian Cox, Professor of Particle Physics in the School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Manchester and astronaut Tim Peake, which gives a unique profile for the system.

822,Olmec - Black on Board Programme,Health Education England,"Health Education England are putting out this notice as a PIN (Prior Information Notice) with a view to completing a Direct Award to Olmec.
The case for direct award can be found on the tender portal.
HEE is seeking a provider to deliver the Black on Board Programme, to increase confidence, create a safe space and train and mentor between 60 - 75% of participants into promotions or board positions within 6 to 12 months of course completion. This programme supports the desired outcomes of the national WRES action plan in relation to Metric 4 and 7 in the first instance, but also 1, 2 and 9. It will also complement the anti-racist strategy being developed and the Anti-Racist Allies programme.
HEE believes that it is highly unlikely for any other supplier to be able to provide the following skills/tools provided by Olmec for the following reasons:
Heath Education England [HEE] believe that Olmec is the only organisation capable of providing this specific development programme, which supports the desired outcomes of the national WRES action plan in relation to Metric 4 (access to training opportunities) and 7 (fair access to career progression) in the first instance, but also 1 (overall representation in the organisation), 2 (recruitment success from shortlisting) and 9 (board representation). It will also complement the anti-racist strategy being developed and the Anti-Racist Allies programme. 
Olmec have been supporting 2-3 cohorts annually over the last 3 years (and originally started to deliver the programme in 2005), mainly for housing associations and local authorities. We believe their scope is also wider than the Ready Now programme, as BoB is open to all BME colleagues regardless of banding (which is how the wider WRES metrics will be addressed). 
This programme is also especially relevant currently, as HEE heads into transition with NHS England (the programme addresses development more broadly and has resulted in people achieving promotion).

The Central Theatre is a 966 all-seated venue in the heart of Chatham offering a mixed programme of shows, including high quality music productions, throughout the year. The specification for the replacement system is outlined in 2.1 below, along with minimum technical requirements for the venue and an image of the floor plan. It is necessary to replace The Central Theatre's sound reinforcement system with a new sound reproduction system that offers Delta Q for constant and even sound coverage and delivers high SPL and clarity across all media. In line with Medway Council's actions to address the climate crisis, the replacement system needs to be one built with sustainability in mind and feature auto standby functions which consume less power, and dual voltage and current feeds which allow the system to self-monitor and deliver voltage only when required. It needs to be powered by an energy supply which provides for the reuse of energy that is wasted in normal D class amplifiers. We require a state of the art sound system which will future-proof The Central Theatre against additional year-on-year spend for the foreseeable future, and additionally assist in the aims of The Central Theatre in increasing sustainability and reducing the venue's carbon footprint. The system will need to be installed by experts who have a strong understanding of the product, and who have experience of installing the system in venues such as The Central Theatre, which is not a purpose-built venue and poses particular challenges with achieving sound consistency across the venue. Quotes for installation should be included in any tender submitted. Quotes for immediate operational training should be included with any tender submitted. The Contract is anticipated to commence in September 2022 and it is anticipated that initial installation should take no more than one week, with the potential for some 'fine tuning' to take place into October. Installation and snagging must be conducted around existing venue commitments.",Opportunity,,Theatre construction work - 45212322.

834,Provision of Services relating to the Development of a Child Abuse Questionnaire and Safeguarding Procedures,Office for National Statistics,"The aim of this research is to design two questionnaires and an appropriate safeguarding procedure. This will be based on topic knowledge, user requirements, cognitive testing with key participant groups, and engagement with topic experts and stakeholders. 

      The requirement is defined as two questionnaires as it is essential prevalence estimates are produced for children aged 11 to 17 years and adults aged 18 to 25 years. However, we recognise there may be variations in the questionnaire across ages within these groups, such as the questions and survey text. Alongside this, an appropriate safeguarding procedure should be designed which successfully contributes to ensuring the participants are safe from others who may put them at significant risk of harm. 

      ONS will be establishing a steering group to ensure stakeholders and key topic experts are consulted in the design and approach. The terms of reference for the group will be designed by ONS and the chair and secretariat (for example, hosting and minute taking) will also be provided by ONS. It is desirable that the supplier will be able to help recruit for the group based on their connections with experts in the field and collaborate with ONS in using this group to ensure a successful outcome for the project. Potential suppliers are encouraged to set out their ability to do so in their bid. 

      The research has been split into two parts, A, and B. Although they focus on different aspects, the two parts of research are not independent of each other as they will need to be approached simultaneously to ensure the survey questions provide information needed for appropriate safeguarding to be administered. 

      For part A, two final questionnaires should be provided that have undergone cognitive testing with key participant groups. The final deliverable includes a report detailing the: 
      -text within the survey, such as the introduction to the survey and topics (which may vary by age)  
      -questions (which may vary by age)  
      -question ordering and routing (which may vary by age)  
      -survey length  
      -adaptations to include those with SEND  
      -derivations needed between questions to produce the required prevalence estimates  

      For part B, a safeguarding procedure should be provided in relation to part A. The final deliverable includes a report outlining the safeguarding procedure detailing: 
      -any variations in its application across the devolved nations and encompassing regions  
      -any variations in its application across the different modes and ages  
      -the risks associated with the procedures   
      -operational requirements for its implementation  

      For both parts (A and B), the final report should also include:

852,SC22212 - Waste Treatment and/or Final Disposal (WTFD) Services (Market Engagement),Kent County Council,"The Kent County Council (KCC) wishes to engage with suppliers regarding capacity in the market to provide future Waste Treatment and/or Final Disposal (WTFD) Services.

KCC's existing contracts for WTFD services are due to end April and July 2023, respectively. These contracts encompass the disposal of bulky waste (non-hazardous), fly tips, beach cleansing, street cleansing, marine carcasses, and other materials including (but not limited to) carpets and mattresses. KCC currently disposes of around 27,000 tonnes per annum arising from Kent Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRCs), kerbside collections, and trade waste received at KCC's waste transfer stations.

Please see Appendix A (Demand for WTFD Services 2021/22) and Appendix B (Breakdown of Material 2021/22) for the current demand for these services in terms of types of material and volumes. This document will be available on the Kent Business Portal (see above).

It is KCC's intention to incorporate within the new contract(s) for WTFD services contingency arrangements for the temporary receipt and disposal of residual waste, as part of a business continuity solution when there are unplanned/unforeseen shutdowns at the Allington EfW facility; these incidents are infrequent but will enable KCC as the Waste Disposal Authority to fulfil its statutory duty.

KCC is looking to identify and understand alternative methods for the disposal of 'bulky' waste that cannot be disposed of at the Allington EfW facility, and that is currently disposed of mainly as RDF. Landfill is not a desired option.

KCC is also looking to maximise the recycling of materials within this waste stream wherever possible and seeking to identify and understand from the market how this could be achieved and improved upon from current recycling rates, (for example segregation of hard plastics) taking into consideration the UK Government targets around Net Zero and Climate Change.

Please note that the Kent Household Waste Recycling Centres (HWRCs) and Waste Transfer Stations have extremely limited capacity for sorting any bulky waste on the sites so material sorting may be required to be conducted at the Provider's facility.

It should also be noted that the Environment Agency has undertaken an investigation and confirmed the widespread presence of Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and other hazardous chemicals in both the textiles and foam of upholstered domestic seating.

The law requires that POPs in waste are destroyed to prevent lasting environmental harm and impacts on the food chain. This means waste containing POPs must be incinerated and must not be re-used, recycled or landfilled; as such, the market must consider the handling and processing of certain waste items identified under this legislation, as being components of this contract.

This procurement will be structured into lots, but the lot structure is still to be determined.",Opportunity,,Refuse and waste related services - 90500000,England,,KENT001-DN630814-15669092, 1 September 2022,30-Sep-22,,,,,,Yes,No,Molly Roast,"County Hall, Maidstone, ME14 1XQ, United Kingdom",+44 3000414141,Molly.Roast@kent.gov.uk,http://www.kent.gov.uk ,,,,

Description:  
Health Education England are putting out this notice as a PIN (Prior Information Notice) with a view to completing a Direct Award to Shuri Network.

The case for direct award can be found on the tender portal.

HEE is seeking a provider to provide a range of education, training and development opportunities for women from ethnic minority backgrounds working in or wanting to enter the DDaT profession in health and care.
These programmes will be developed in partnership with HEE DRE and will be designed by the supplier to meet the development needs identified from the target community.
HEE believes that it is highly unlikely for any other supplier to be able to provide the following skills/tools provided by Shuri Network as a current supplier for the following reasons:

1.	The Shuri Network, founded in 2019, is the only specialist network supporting women from ethnic minority backgrounds in digital health and care in the UK. 
2.	The network has access to expertise from a wide range of senior leaders in digital health and care, who have publicly supported the network. This includes the NHSE Director of Transformation, the HEE CEO, the NHS Digital CEO, the NHSE CNIO and the NHS Digital Chief Medical Officer and Chief Nurse.
3.	The network has over 2,200 members and allies, who support the network, from all areas of the health and social care system. The network regularly seeks feedback for its members and designs programmes tailored to meet the needs of women from ethnic minority backgrounds.
4.	The network's Fellowship and bursary programmes have created a group of around 100 Fellows who contribute both to the ongoing development of the network and Shuri programmes, and to digital developments and policies at local and national level across the country.
5.	The network has good connections with ICSs and an in-depth understanding of national, regional and ICS digital delivery and workforce priorities and challenges. It is therefore well-placed to support ICSs to deliver digital innovation and develop their pipeline of digital leaders and champions .

The Rapid Investigation Team (RIT) has a national remit across England to support the rapid investigation and response to disease outbreaks at their source, with the aim of limiting its impact and preventing further spread/harm. On-site outbreak investigation, including the collection of biological and environmental samples along with contextual qualitative and quantitative data are also within the RIT's remit. 

Further detail of the pathogens that may require investigation and sampling are included within the Bacteriology reference department user manual : Virus reference department user manual , and Food Water and  Environmental Microbiology reference manual ; 

The RIT requires rapid biological and environmental sampling services (including domiciliary community sampling) that are readily available to support outbreak and incident investigation and response. These services are outsourced to relieve the pressure on internal clinical resources and to provide a more rapid and convenient service to the individuals identified as requiring sample collection across England. 

The collection of biological samples is considered a public task under UKHSA's responsibility in responding to public health emergencies and does not require ethical approval from the Health Research Authority or other regulatory authority.

The aim of this request for information is to understand the markets' ability to meet the Authority's needs of this service and deliverables; to ensure that there is consistent and affordable provision of high quality, safe and compliant Sampling Services in England to support the response to communicable and non-communicable disease control.

891,Early engagement notice - The distribution of Net Zero co-benefits,The Committee On Climate Change,"The Climate Change Committee (CCC) is an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act 2008. Our purpose is to advise the UK and devolved governments on emissions targets and to report to Parliament on progress made in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and preparing for and adapting to the impacts of climate change.
The CCC's Sixth Carbon Budget  scenarios imply growing and enduring savings in operating costs, alongside a major investment programme. To 2030, the largest cost increases affecting households are for decarbonising buildings. Large savings are available for households in other areas, most notably in transport from the shift to electric cars. However, even in areas where costs are likely to fall relative to today, the distribution of costs and savings could create both 'winners' and 'losers' during the transition.
Achieving Net Zero in the UK will also result in significant benefits to human health from better air quality, less noise, more active travel and a shift to healthier diets. Changes to land use and farming practices that cut emissions can also improve air quality and water quality and benefit biodiversity, resilience to climate change and bring recreational benefits. Benefits could partially or fully offset costs.
As set out in the CCC's Sixth Carbon Budget advice, a key challenge on the path to Net Zero is how to spread the costs and benefits of the transition across the economy: for households, businesses and the Exchequer. The CCC recently commissioned Frontier Economics to develop a set of household archetypes (using Ofgem's archetypes  as a starting point) and a distributional impacts model, to explore the costs faced by households from decarbonising homes and transport. The archetypes developed are shown in Table 1.
This analysis will only tell part of the story, as it does not yet incorporate the co-benefits enjoyed by households alongside any direct financial costs or savings. We are therefore interested in exploring the co-benefits of our Sixth Carbon Budget scenarios that the 15 archetypes developed by Frontier could face. 
We are inviting feedback on early procurement ideas for this, to gauge the feasibility of undertaking credible and robust analysis in this space, before deciding whether to put out a project to tender.

983,High Pressure Washing for Radiological Decontamination of Concrete Surfaces,Defra Network eTendering Portal,"The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is commissioning small-scale research to investigate the viability of high-pressure washing for decontaminating UK concrete building materials following a major radiation incident. Defra is the designated Lead Government Department in England for coordinating the recovery from Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) incidents in England. To that end, Defra facilitates UK access to decontamination capabilities for buildings, environment, and infrastructure following a CBRN incident. When not recovering from a CBRN event, Defra develops recovery policy and operational capability by working closely with cross government colleagues, academia, and industry.
The aim of this project is to test the suitability of high-pressure washing procedures to decontaminate UK concrete surfaces contaminated with 85Sr, 137Cs, and 152Eu. This project consists of 2 stages. 
The objectives of stage 1 of this project are:
-	Source suitable concrete samples from the UK built environment and then contaminate with 85Sr, 137Cs, and 152Eu under laboratory conditions (Objective 1).

-	Measure radionuclide depth profiles after aging the contaminated samples for a maximum of 2 months. This aging period is considered representative of decontamination operations after a significant radiation incident (Objective 2).

The objectives of stage 2 of this project are:

-	Determine the effect of three different water pressures (between 2,000 and 7,000 psi) on the radionuclide removal rates from contaminated concrete samples (Objective 3).

-	Examine the potential for high pressure washing to induce aesthetic and/or physical damage to the decontaminated materials by visual inspection and appropriate microscopy technique(s) (Objective 4).
It is important to note that the duration of stage 1 of the project is 5.5 months. A 6-month extension to the project is available for stage 2, subject to satisfactory completion of stage 1. It is acceptable for Tenderers to submit a tender for stage 1 of the project only.",Opportunity,30-Aug-22,Research and development services and related consultancy services - 73000000,London,£0,tender_313109/1098584,17-Aug-22,23-Sep-22,12pm,10-Oct-22,31-Mar-23,Service contract,Open procedure (below threshold),Yes,Yes,Defra,"17 Nobel House, London, SW1P 3JR, England",0,DGCEnquiries@defra.gov.uk,https://defra.bravosolution.co.uk ,,,,

The Town team's overarching vision is that the buildings should remain community assets and that they will be utilised to provide something new and different.  The project also seeks to identify the role these buildings might play in rejuvenating the town centre and improving Lostwithiel's destination status.
The successful bidder will be required to agree the Demand Study methodology in conjunction with the Town Team, acknowledging that this will need to include a public consultation strategy. It is envisaged that the first stage of the community engagement will
be led by the Town Team with input from the appointed consultant and that the second stage, with considered and viable options, will be led by the consultant with input from the Town Team.

A transport and sustainable travel study for the town is also being commissioned by the Town Team to run in parallel with this study. The appointed Heritage Buildings consultant will need to liaise and be aware of how those proposals may impact upon, and be
beneficial to, the future opportunity for this project.

The study should include an examination of the economic context of Lostwithiel and consider projections for economic growth taking into account how the overall economy of the area could change in the future.

The appointed consultant will also be expected to undertake a strategic level sift of the options to identify any that might be inconsistent with the Council's commitment to tackling the Climate Emergency.

1018,Grasscare and Hedgecutting on the Woodbridge Town Council estate,Woodbridge Town Council,"Introduction
Woodbridge Town Council (WTC) are seeking an organisation to undertake the mowing/ grass care and hedge cutting of three sites on its estate in the Parish of Woodbridge, Suffolk. WTC are considering the grounds maintenance requirements on its estate from April 2023, and therefore seek to understand the standalone cost of the mowing/ grass care and hedge cutting on its estate. 

Overview
Whilst it is expected that WTC will undertake the gardening of smaller grassed areas on the Council's estate, the mowing/ grass care and hedge cutting of Elmhurst Park, Kingston Field and Fen Meadow are expected to be beyond the mechanical capability of the Council (Mostly in terms of the ability to store and operate the machinery expected to be required for this task, as well as the removal of any cuttings). 

Interested parties
Woodbridge Town Council are seeking a contractor to undertake the above detailed work from April 1st 2023, for an initial period of three years. 
Contractors are welcome to arrange a site visit with the Town Clerk, Mr Greg Diaper, who can be contacted via email - townclerk@woodbridge-suffolk.gov.uk.

With up to ?559 million in funding available (?1m for Portsmouth), Multiply has the potential to reach adults across the whole United Kingdom over the next three years; improving their functional numeracy skills.

1032,RWM703 - Site Characterisation Interpretation Support,Radioactive Waste Management Ltd,"RWM (NWS) is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (""NDA"") and is the body responsible for implementing geological disposal of higher activity radioactive wastes. Government policy has confirmed that RWM will act as the developer of a Geological Disposal Facility (GDF) for such wastes. As such, RWM is responsible for ensuring that the siting, construction, operation and eventual closure of a GDF are carried out in a manner which adheres to, and complies with, the UK's high standards of safety, security and environmental protection, as well as applicable requirements which are set out in relevant policy documentation.

RWM has identified Search Areas with adjacent inshore areas (offshore up to the 12 nautical mile UK territorial limit) to be investigated. The geological understanding of each area is different and is determined by the complexity of the geological setting, the amount of previously published information and the quantity and quality of legacy data (historic oil and gas seismic and well data, mining boreholes etc). 

RWM are in the process of instigating Contract, RWM169 (Site Evaluation, Lot 2, underway) which is tasked with producing an initial understanding of the search areas, based on accessible public datasets (for example held by BGS or published in peer reviewed journals) and the outcomes of previous studies (such as NIREX). RWM also is undertaking a first look analysis of legacy oil and gas data, carried out under Contract RWM400 (Site Characterisation, underway). The output from these two works will be delivered as a series of databases, reports and an overarching synthesis report to this Contractor.

The next stage of work is this Site Characterisation Interpretation work package, which will enable RWM to move from the initial general understanding gained from the work carried out under RWM169 and RWM400, described above, to a more integrated site-specific understanding. This requires the evaluation of additional legacy data and new seismic data sets, being acquired by RWM. These additional data include further legacy 2D and 3D seismic and borehole data for all search areas, plus newly acquired seismic data, starting with a 250 km2 3D seismic volume for offshore Copeland (acquired by RWM in August 2022). Further seismic campaigns are being considered for other search areas.

The focus of this Site Characterisation Interpretation work will be on developing a fully integrated and detailed understanding of the potential GDF host rock volume for each site. This will include an evaluation of its geometries, including structural and stratigraphic variations, based on detailed analysis of the regional, sub-regional and site-specific sub surface.",Opportunity,,Geological and geophysical consultancy services - 71351200.

Content ranges from showcasing of our programmes in Arts and Education, to educational videos for our English teaching offer, to internal communication and training videos to promotional content and corporate videos.  Whilst some of our video content is currently created in-house, increasingly we need to commission video content externally. To ensure creative quality and brand consistency, along with cost-effectiveness. Via this procurement exercise we are looking to set up a framework of suppliers who can get to know our brand and deliver to a high standard. 
      The framework will be made up of two lots: 
      o General video production (Please see Annex 6 for more information with regards to examples of video content) and 
      o Specialist education videos and audio.
      The British Council has an established brand and identity which all agencies on the framework will be expected to understand and follow. In addition, we have two separate brands with their own identities - IELTS and Study UK. All agencies on the framework will be expected to understand and follow their guidelines. All our assets and guidelines are stored on the British Council Brand Hub and tendering agencies can request access to familiarise themselves with our brands.  
      The purpose and scope of this ITT and supporting documents is to explain in further detail the requirements of the British Council and the process for submitting a tender proposal. 
      No guarantee of work will be provided in the event that a supplier is placed on either framework. Each call-off contract (commission) will be subject to the call-off arrangements for each framework. Suppliers are able to submit a bid for one or both lots.
      Framework suppliers will be required to respond to a wide variety of work, some 'low cost/quick turnaround' items and then larger scale pieces of activity, all varying in cost. How this engagement will be managed will be part of the supplier briefing following the completion of this tender exercise.

The service model is a ""Mixed Model"" in which the Contracting Authority will, in the majority of cases, provide the surgeon and anaesthetist (within NHS contracted time) and the Service Provider(s) will provide the rest of the pathway, from admission to discharge. The pathways must recognise minimum standards and protocols within the NHS for the relevant surgical procedures (in accordance with the Terms and Conditions of Contract), whilst recognising where appropriate the Service Provider's own protocols and methods for meeting these minimum standards and protocols.

1218,Offender Personality Disorder (OPD) Services to HMP High Down - NHS England,"NHS SOUTH, CENTRAL AND WEST COMMISSIONING SUPPORT UNIT","NHS England (the Commissioner) seeks to commission Offender Personality Disorder (OPD) Services to HMP High Down. The Commissioner will be contracting for the services using the National NHS Standard Contract.

HMP High Down has recently changed its role, moving from being a Category B local prison to a Category C resettlement and training prison.

As part of this change, the self-contained health care unit is being decommissioned and will be developed into a self-contained Psychologically Informed Planned Environment (PIPE) unit. 

The Services delivered will consist of two elements:

The use of the self-contained unit will form the first element of the service and will be based on a Progression PIPE model. The intended target group are men who have mild to moderate learning disabilities and who have completed treatment elsewhere. This service will also focus on providing additional support to men transitioning into and out of the unit. 

This will be the first unit of its type in the Category C prison estate working specifically with men who have a mild to moderate learning disability within a PIPE environment. There will be 23 spaces on the unit and the service will be open to men who have committed all offence types. It will be a national resource, with most referrals likely to be from other sites.

The second element of the service is a wider, non-residential, service for men who meet the criteria for an OPD service within HMP High Down. This service will serve both PCoSO (Person Convicted of Sexual Offences) and non-PCoSO populations. 

This intervention service is designed to support the outcomes of the Offender Personality Disorder (OPD) Pathway by providing services that deliver individually tailored and psychologically informed interventions directly to people screened onto the pathway, which aims to enhance the management of risk of serious harm to others and re-offending, and develop psychological wellbeing and social engagement. 

The service will be delivered by a joint approach between the health service provider and HMPPS. 

The Commissioners seek tender responses from providers who have the capability and capacity to undertake such a contract.

The Contract will be for a term of 7 years. Services are scheduled to commence on 1st April 2023. 

The maximum total contract value is £4,040,000 (inclusive of mobilisation funding of up to £50,000 in Year 1). This envelope relates to the provision provided by the health service provider only. Separate funding is being made available to support the HMPPS element of service delivery at HMP High Down.

All tender information MUST be submitted through the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal.

Context

The UK's research and innovation system tackles national and global challenges, supports economic growth, productivity and cultural richness, and fosters private R&D investment. 

In order to remain sustainable, our research and innovation system must be able to meet present R&D needs without depleting its ability to meet future needs (as set out in the Government's R&D roadmap, Plan for Growth and Innovation Strategy). Achieving this requires sufficient financial inputs as well as a critical mass of talent and capability, a thriving research environment, and action to address environmental sustainability. 

However, as the Government advances its plans to make the UK a science superpower and increase public spending on R&D, research-performing organisations are reporting financial pressures associated with covering long-term costs and investing in the underpinning capability needed to respond quickly to new opportunities and priorities, and research leaders have expressed concern that the costs of research are rising faster than inflation.

Aim 

The aim of this study is to develop and demonstrate a methodological approach that will enable UKRI to better understand the underlying costs of research, how these costs are changing over time, and the drivers behind the observed trends. It will provide robust evidence (quantitative data and qualitative analysis) of the drivers of change and the extent to which the costs of research have changed over the past 10 years. 

Bidders should develop a proposal that outlines a robust methodology that would support an exploration of the changing costs of research in UK universities and UKRI-funded research institutes. 

Please ensure you review all attached information to ensure a full understanding of this requirement. All attachments can be found with the Supplier Attachments tab within the Jaggaer eSourcing Portal. 

This contract will be awarded based on the evaluation criteria as set out in the ITQ document.

1248,Viability of developing a screening tool to assess non-standard bioaccumulation potential of chemical substances in aquatic and terrestrial wildlife,DEPARTMENT FOR ENVIRONMENT FOOD & RURAL AFFAIRS,"""The Chemical Assessment Unit (CAU; Chief Scientist's Group - Research, Environment and Business Directorate, Environment Agency) supports the UK Chemicals Agency (the Health and Safety Executive, HSE) on the environmental aspects of the UK Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction of Chemicals (REACH) legislation. A crucial part of our work is hazard assessment of industrial and consumer chemicals, and the correct assignment of bioaccumulation potential is a fundamental component of such assessments.

Currently, there are no validated test guidelines or methods to screen for chemicals that preferentially bioaccumulate in non-lipid rich tissues (e.g. muscle, liver, serums). This project aims to identify what alternative tests are available or could be developed and used to screen for this form of bioaccumulation as a regulatory requirement under UK REACH; specifically in relation to Persistent, Bioaccumulative and Toxic and very Persistent very Bioaccumulative (henceforth PBT) assessment and exposure modelling. 

If suitable methods can be identified, we would like to understand how they would trigger the determination of BioConcentration Factors (BCF;or other bioaccumulation metrics) in aquatic and dietary exposure studies. For example, can equivalent threshold metrics, e.g.:
•	Log KOW > 4.5 be established for screening for a high potential for bioaccumulation in an aquatic organism
•	Log KOW > 2 (in combination with a log KOA¬ > 5) be established for a high potential for bioaccumulation in air-breathing organisms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     The objective of this project is to provide relevant up-to-date evidence and understanding on the types of study that could inform non-standard accumulation processes in aquatic and terrestrial wildlife. It will also provide a critical review of current understanding and contemporary methods, identifying uncertainties in generated data and the applicability of methods to different substance types.

Buildings on site are grade 2 listed and are in various states of condition and repair, requiring specialist attention from English Heritage and Conservations Officer, in order to cater for future redevelopment proposals.

      The number of pupils requiring a place in special provision is growing, specifically in secondary. The number of pupils with Education Healthcare Plans (EHCP) has been growing in line with the birth rate, the larger primary school cohorts are now moving through to secondary meaning additional special secondary provision is required. The requirement for the capacity of the new school is based on the existing school sites. Split between 88 secondary space and 44 primary, 132 spaces are expected but will allow the school to expand further as additional places are required

      Woodfield School is currently on a split site with the primary phase on Stoneleigh Road and Secondary phase on Hawthorne Lane. Current recommendation is that both phases of Woodfield School to be relocated onto the new site, be the main occupant and driver of the new education development where the provision of SEN are able to function across all Key Stages whilst maintaining the quality of provision. Current Woodfield school's provisions are not adequate to unify these divisions on one campus. Redevelopment of the woodlands site resolves these issues.

An alcove was created as part of the original construction of the building with the intention of installing a ground floor to 1st-floor mezzanine goods lift (non-person carrying) but budget constraints prevented installation at that time. This contract will seek to complete this process of a goods lift installation.
The lift installation will need to be free-standing and not require any form of lift pit to be dug or set into the floor of the building, other than any retaining bolts or floor fixings. All information relating to the dimensions of the alcove and lift size required is found in Annex A of the documentation.
The following appendices will also assist your submission:
Annex G - Fleet Air Arm Museum / RNAS Yeovilton SHEF Agreement. 
Annex H - Cobham Hall Drawings / Photo's (showing configuration and alcove location).
Annex I - Cobham Visitor Directions - Site Location.

Site Visits are encouraged. The NMRN may require Tenderer's to visit the site of work during the tender process in order to further understand the requirements of the NMRN Tender.

1341,CWC22114 - Wolverhampton Central Library Façade Refurbishment,Wolverhampton City Council,"The Wolverhampton Central Library façade and building envelope is in much need of repair and

restoration. The Central Library is a grade II* listed building. It was constructed in 1900-1902 to

the designs of the prolific competition-winning architect Henry Thomas Hare (1861-1921), who

specialised in libraries public buildings in the 'free Jacobean' style. The library has fine brick and

terracotta facades to the street fronts, with simpler brick elevations to the rear courtyard. William

Aumonier of London was involved in the modelling of the decorative terracotta. The roofs are

steeply pitched and tiled on the street fronts, but shallow pitched and slated to the rear. High

quality detailing includes a pair of copper domes and a tall fleche to the main entrance. Inside,

there is good stained glass and plasterwork and a dramatic staircase to the first floor reading

rooms.

The Library is an excellent example of its date, well-built in high quality materials. However, at 120

years old, it is now in need of a programme of repair, including to the roofs and terracotta. As

terracotta repairs are only likely to have a 20-25 year lifespan it is proposed that, where terracotta

is damaged, it should be replaced, in a matching material. This is a time-consuming specialist

procedure. Numerous other repairs to the façade and building envelope should be attended to at

the same time, to make best use of scaffolding.

As part of this consultation SBC want to engage with providers to understand the software and functionality available within the market which meet its needs in achieving efficiency in both statutory and non statutory processes. Following early engagement, SBC will make a decision about how they wished to proceed in either solely retaining the current provider, or to commence an appropriate procurement.

Suppliers are requested to submit an expression of interest to the Council.  The Council will then determine appropriate engagement, which may be via face to face meetings, group meetings, or virtual meetings, which shall take place during September 2022.  In submitting their expression of interest, suppliers are requested to submit relevant market material.  Such material shall not be used in any procurement but may be used to support the determination of what model of engagement is required with a supplier.  Suppliers should note that not submitting an expression of interest does not effect their ability to enter or succeed in any subsequent competition.

Please submit your expression of interest via craig.lorne@slough.gov.uk.

1374,HEE - NHS Employers for Advanced Practice Governance and Podiatry Toolkits,Health Education England,"Health Education England are putting out this notice as a PIN (Prior Information Notice) with a view to completing a Direct Award to NHS Employers.

The case for direct award can be found on the tender portal.

HEE wishes to commission NHE Employers to publish both the Centre's Governance Maturity Matrix and an updated interactive Podiatry Toolkit on the NHS Employers website. The Maturity Matrix will be a self-help tool for employers across the NHS to use and have a narrative of how to use advanced practice with signposting to relevant resources. NHS Employers team will engage with employers through the dedicated networks with colleagues across the NHS on the governance and work with colleagues to develop good practice case studies.
2.1.	The Centre's Governance Maturity Matrix Toolkit
2.1.1.	Employer engagement
2.1.2.	Creation of good practise case studies
2.2.	Podiatry toolkit

HEE believes that it is highly unlikely for any other supplier to be able to provide the following skills/tools provided by NHS Employers as a current supplier for the following reasons:

NHS Employers is the employers' organisation for the NHS in England, they have established networks with Human Resource Directors across the whole of England, as well as training and education leads, recruitment managers and apprenticeship leads which are key to ensuring the messages we want to raise in relation to the allied health professional workforce and advancing practice are heard by these workforce leaders. They are also part of the NHS Confederation and as such have established links to employers within Mental Health, Primary Care, and Integrated Care Systems, which will support our work in raising the profile across the entire system.

NHS Employers host the current employers' guide to podiatry, mean this tool can be updated rather than created. The current users will be notified of the update, rather than the need to rebuild engagement from the ground up on another platform.

This puts NHS Employers in an un-parallel position to publicise, socialise and engage with employers as they strive for a safe and effective workforce.

https://health-family-contract-search.secure.force.com/?SearchType=Projects

All communications should be made via the messaging function on the Health Family eTendering portal.

If any provider has concerns with the commissioning intentions outlined within the published documentation, please raise this via the eTendering Portal in the first instance within 30 days of the date of this Prior Information Notice.

'Whole family' therapeutic approaches means that family members are clinically triaged for their individual needs, but interventions are co-ordinated/concurrently delivered.
This Service specification for tender has been designed to respond to the needs of children, young people and families from across Merseyside, as identified by them. There is clear need for earlier mental health and wellbeing support for families right across Merseyside and so this tender is open to applications from all boroughs equally. We advise bidders to seek funding only for what they require/can deliver in the timeframe, as there may be scope in this budget to deliver more than one Service in different areas of Merseyside. However, MVRP will only fund one Service per borough and so encourages partnership/collaborative applications.
The Service(s) should take a primary or secondary / early intervention and prevention approach, receiving referrals from a combination of community/non-statutory and statutory services. This is not a crisis intervention service(s). The Service(s) will be community-based in Merseyside and will need to evidence cultural intelligence/competence to best meet the needs of the community, addressing inequality of access to mental health and wellbeing support. It aims to support recovery from trauma/adversity and build resilience to reduce vulnerabilities of children and young people from experiencing violence. 
MVRP are looking for Provider(s) who are equipped to mobilise quickly to explore this early intervention, whole family approach to improving sustainable wellbeing.

1420,Value to investors of non-financial reporting: early market engagement,Business Energy and Industrial Strategy,"The Business Frameworks Directorate in the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) wishes to understand what value investors place on non-financial reporting requirements in the Companies Act 2006.  

There has been growing interest from lobbyists and stakeholders in requiring companies to provide information on how their activities impact on wider society; and how companies could be used to deliver societal change. This has led to companies being required, via the Companies Act, to provide non-financial reporting (NFR) to allow stakeholders to assess a company's performance against several key areas. Whilst it is difficult, but feasible, to assess the costs for companies to produce this information, it has been challenging to quantify the benefit to users given that the information is provided freely. In the absence of a market for non-financial information, non-market valuation techniques are required to estimate benefits. 

Investors are seen as an important group driving non-financial reporting disclosures as they perceive NFR activity by preparers as a sign that preparers are engaging in risk management activity . For example, the ""logic model"" for non-financial reporting assumes that :

•	Users receive relevant and useful NFR information,
•	Users better understand non-financial risks, and some decisions, e.g. investment decisions, change in scope, timing or scale, as a result of this information; and results in
•	More informed investment, business or other decisions that lead to better social outcomes.

Therefore, the NFR ""narrative"" places those that make investments, i.e. investors who are mainly intermediaries, as the agents by which social outcomes would be transformed by NFR. The aim of this research is to assess the extent to which this assumption is correct: in particular whether those who make investment decisions place a positive, and significant, value on NFR, and on what NFR in particular. The research will also consider direct and indirect channels for generating value. For example, NFR may add value directly through better risk management and lower costs; or indirectly through a better brand, which people are willing to pay more to ""buy"" into. 
The population of interest is investors. The group of investors should be representative of the market and include a mix of active and passive investors . Identifying the population of investors is likely to be the most challenging part of the brief and we would like to discuss ideas with potential bidders during the early market engagement.  Following the early market engagement event, we would welcome individual discussions with suppliers to discuss the specification in more depth. Bidders should consider in their bids whether it would be desirable to include at least one financial reporting attribute in the attribute set to provide an accurate valuation of NFR attributes.",Opportunity,,Social research services - 79315000,United Kingdom,,Value to investors of non-financial reporting: early market engagement,17-Aug-22,26-Sep-22,,,,,,Yes,No,Neil Golborne,"1 Victoria Street, London, SW1H0ET, England",07741 617218,neil.golborne@beis.gov.uk,https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-business-energy-and-industrial-strategy ,,,,

(YC) Support Service for those young people involved in caring roles and
responsibilities. The duration of the contract will be for 3 years with the option to extend the
contract by 1 + 1 year (possible 5 year contract).

The Council is seeking a provider who can develop and deliver an outcomes focused support
service, providing a range of support and interventions to Young Carers. In addition, there
will be an element of the provider undertaking Awareness Raising and Training of services on
identifying and understanding the needs of Young Carers.

A Young Carer is defined for the purposes of this tender as a child under the age of 18 and up
to 25 years if the young carer has additional needs (please refer to specification for more details), who provides or intends to provide care for another person (of any age, except where that care is provided for payment, pursuant to a contract or as voluntary work).

A young carer becomes vulnerable when the level of care-giving and responsibility to the
person in need of care becomes excessive or inappropriate for that child, risking impacting
on his or her emotional or physical well-being and/or educational achievement and life
chances.

The Children and Families Act 2014 amended the Children Act to make it easier for young
carers to get an assessment of their needs and to introduce 'whole family' approaches to
assessment and support. The authority wishes to commission a provider to undertake
assessments, and support the child's wellbeing, education and development, as well as raise
awareness across the community of issues relevant to young carers.

      CIRAS provides a confidential health and safety reporting service, enabling staff in our 1900 member companies to raise concerns whilst having their identity protected. A simplified summary of the service is as follows:
      - A reporter contacts CIRAS with a concern via webform, freephone or freepost
      - CIRAS raises a case in dynamics CRM to manage the interaction
      - CIRAS interviews the reporter to obtain full information about the concern and information to ensure we can protect their identity
      - CIRAS packages up their concern and passes to the relevant company for action
      - The company responds to explain what they have done
      - CIRAS shares the response with the reporter so they can see the impact they had.
      - The is an urgency in making the app available ASAP to increase reporting rates

      Different people will prefer to use different routes for contacting CIRAS, and we want to make this as easy as possible. The rationale for an app includes:
      - Enabling more people to raise their concerns by providing an additional channel that works better for some people
      - Having an app on a user's phone/device serves as a reminder the service is there for them, so they are more likely to use it.

As a part of our strategy the university is seeking to extend its portfolio into the UK and Global online market to capitalise on its growing reputation as a leading applied and entrepreneurial university.

The university is seeking a commercial partnership to develop, scale and grow our online portfolio and extend our brand nationally and globally, in an operationally and financially sustainable way. We expect the partnership to be for up to 12 years with a value of up to £50m for the partner. We are looking for an online education partner with a considerable track record of partnering with Higher Education institutions, who will work with us to develop a new wholly online portfolio of post-graduate courses that reflect our ambition to be the world's leading applied university and ensure we are able to reach prospective students on a UK and global stage.

We are not seeking a model whereby the University only validates or accredits the provision - our vision for an online portfolio is founded on the premise that our online students will feel a part of Sheffield Hallam University and will be able to benefit from our teaching, learning and distinctive Hallam Model. We are not however expecting there to be any mandatory attendance on campus as a part of the course delivery; the desired model is a fully online one.

The university's current online portfolio (c.22 courses of which 17 are postgraduate level) has been developed organically for a Continuing Professional Development (CPD) market, predominantly in the health and education areas. We are not seeking in the first instance to replace any of this existing provision; rather we are looking to develop an additional offer with potential to attract high student numbers from both UK and international markets.

1627,Dynamic Purchasing System for the provision of Alternative Education,Derby City Council,"Kingsmead School in Derby has a statutory duty to make arrangements for the provision of suitable education otherwise than at school for children of compulsory school age who, by reason of exclusion from school or otherwise, will not receive a suitable education without these arrangements.

Derby City Council, on behalf of Kingsmead School, now  wishes to invite applications for inclusion on a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) for these services. By creating a DPS we will give Kingsmead School the flexibility of allowing new organisations to join at any time over the course of the DPS, subject to them meeting the initial suitability criteria which  will be set out in the DPS.

All service requirements over the course of the DPS will then be tendered by way of mini-competition, allowing all  organisations on the DPS at that time the opportunity to bid for the requirements at what would be a market appropriate rate at that time.  

Other Free Schools, Academies and Independent Schools within the city of Derby may also access the DPS with the support of Kingsmead School. 

The DPS will operate from 01/06/2018 and is currently expected to run to 31/05/2023. 

This notice advises that Round Twenty Seven is now open and closes 10.00am  01/08/2022 with applications assessed by 31/08/2022. 

Further rounds will operate on a similar two monthly basis. 

There are options for annual extensions for a further 2 years beyond 31/05/2023.

An EU Light Touch procurement tender exercise which is compliant with the Public Contract Regulations 2015 will be undertaken to select providers for the DPS which will offer access to pre-approved DPS Providers who can be appointed using an efficient and streamlined procurement process; therefore ensuring the Council obtains value for money whilst enabling objectives to be achieved.

For clarity, this DPS is not a full DPS as defined under the Public Contract Regulations 2015, Regulation 34, but is a modified version.

And yet the city and many of its communities face significant challenges. It's the most unequal city in the UK based on income distribution, with exceptionally high housing costs, congestion, poor social mobility and environmental stress (not least on water supply) contributing to an imbalanced and sub-optimal set of outcomes.  The gap in life expectancy between most prosperous and least prosperous wards is one stark indicator of this imbalance.  

To provide a sustainable and high quality of life for everyone who lives, works and studies in the city, and to allow its communities to thrive within a ""one planet"" understanding of its resource consumption, decision makers and communities in Cambridge need a richer understanding of how the sometimes competing economic, social and environmental priorities interact, and how they change over time.

This contract ends on 31st October 2023 and the Public Health team is commencing pre-market engagement activity.

We are looking to partner with an organisation, or series of organisations, to work with us to improve the health and well-being of people in Devon.  Taking action on the biggest preventable risk factors for ill health and premature death including tobacco, obesity, alcohol, and physical inactivity, will have major positive impacts on people's health and wellbeing and improve overall health outcomes for Devon.   Through building networks of support and supporting community resilience, we want to work collaboratively to address the wider determinants of health focussing most on those areas and groups where the poorest health outcomes are experienced.

We invite organisations to tell us how they would work alongside communities, Voluntary Community Social Enterprise (VCSE), and system partners to achieve those benefits, including by connecting people with community solutions delivered and facilitated by local organisations and supporting the development of community capacity which responds to people's wishes, aspirations and expectations.  

We are open to different delivery models including the possibility of a lead organisation working collaboratively with local organisations and the VCSE sector in order to understand different communities across Devon and how best to deliver services to meet local needs to reduce health inequalities.  We will also require specific services to meet national standards and frameworks including an evidence-based stop smoking service.

We will be hosting a market warming event later in the year to formally engage with providers and stakeholders.  Prior to that, interested providers are invited to complete the survey link below; this will collect helpful information for us to gauge interest in the market.  Responses to the survey will not be formally evaluated or scored or have any impact on the evaluation of a future tender, should one be undertaken.  In addition, we would be interested in meeting any potential providers who would like to discuss their survey responses in more detail, to help shape our strategy and approach to commissioning this service.

Within the context of our wider Transformation Programme,  L&Q is looking to procure an established Housing Management System and the following supporting services:

It also covers the requirement for future configuration and integration development support. 

      L & Q's Transformation Programme is roughly divided into two linear phases, which we describe as the 'foundation' phase and the 'opportunity' phase.  In summary, these are:
      o Laying Foundations - The implementation of the core functionality provided by a new Housing Management System and a new Finance System. In parallel to these implementations, this phase includes the consolidation of document management capability into an Enterprise Documents Records Management System.
      These new solutions will incorporate L&Q's new target data architecture, and act as enablers for the implementation of improved and more standardised  processes.
      o Realising Opportunities - The Transformation Programme will build on these foundations to deliver critical operational capability, including improvements to L&Q's customer self-service offer, improving operational visibility through an enhanced CRM, while more broadly exploiting opportunities to automate more of what we do.

The aim of this service is to increase sufficiency of high quality placements to enable children and young people to remain as close to their home community as possible. This is based on the principle of accessing the right placement at the right time. Placements offer an asset-based model of service, where the child or young person is supported to achieve positive outcomes, with a focus on supporting placement stability and Permanence. The Flexible Purchasing System aims to achieve improved value for money for placing authorities through greater transparency of pricing and competition through call-off. The proposal is for this to be a continually open framework, the aim to speed up the process for new homes to become available for placements by the authorities.

Providers are invited providers to express and interest and fill in the following questionnaire for market engagement purposes.

https://forms.office.com/r/guTzUHUkcd

Ealing spends circa £1.8m per annum on community emotional wellbeing & mental health services approximately split evenly across both Lots (see below). The Council is looking for efficiencies and innovation to make best use of this budget. It is anticipated that the contract will commence in April 2023 and will be for three (3) years, with two possibilities of one (1) year extension. Total value approximately £9m over 5 years.

In response to an in-depth review last year of the experiences of children, young people, and their parents/carers in both accessing and receiving care from our community emotional wellbeing & MH services, Ealing Council has been working hard to redesign the services that they now wish to commission.

Whilst the process of transformation is far from complete as we continue to revisit existing pathways across and between services and schools and develop a Central Point of Access for all social, emotional wellbeing & MH referrals to Children's Services, we are now seeking experienced providers to join us on our journey.

Our aim is to achieve the best outcomes that we can for our children and families and bring about positive change whilst helping support children and young people to achieve their optimum emotional health and well-being.

It is envisaged that the services to be tendered will be commissioned in two Lots allowing providers to bid for one or both Lots.

Lot 1: This will include those early intervention and prevention services which offer a blended model of training, support, advice and consultation for both families and those professional involved in their care, alongside offering a range of responsive time-limited evidence-based MH interventions to children, young people and their families within a community setting or school.

Lot 2: This will include those services which are aimed at supporting families who are most in need by improving MH and emotional wellbeing. This includes psychology provision which supports statutory services within the Council and helps to manage demand, reduce family and placement breakdown.",Early Engagement,,Health and social work services - 85000000,England,,EALING001-DN623965-70111718,22-Jul-22,13-Oct-22,,,,,,Yes,Yes,Christine Baker,"London Borough of Ealing, Perceval House, 14-16 Uxbridge Road, Ealing, W5 2HL, England",+44 2088255122,bakerc@ealing.gov.uk,http://www.ealing.gov.uk ,,,,

1691,IAPT PWP - Midlands,Health Education England,"Health Education England (HEE) is seeking to commission IAPT Psychological Wellbeing Practitioner (PWP) education  across the Midlands region. 

The Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) programme began in 2008 and has transformed treatment of adult anxiety disorders and depression in England. Over 900,000 people now access IAPT services each year, and the Five Year Forward View for Mental Health committed to expanding services further, alongside improving quality.  It remains an integral part of The NHS Long Term Plan.
IAPT services provide evidence-based treatments for people with anxiety and depression and are characterised by three things:
1.	Evidenced based psychological therapies: with the therapy delivered by fully trained and accredited practitioners, matched to the mental health problem and its intensity and duration designed to optimize outcomes. From April 2018 all clinical commissioning groups are required to offer IAPT services integrated with physical healthcare pathways.
2.	Routine outcome monitoring: so that the person having therapy and the clinician offering it have up-to-date information on an individual's progress. This supports the development of a positive and shared approach to the goals of therapy and as this data is anonymized and published this promotes transparency in service performance encouraging improvement.
3.	Regular and outcomes focused supervision, so practitioners are supported to continuously improve and deliver high quality care.

The priorities for service development are:
•	Expanding services so that at least 1.5m adults access care each year by 2020/21. This means that IAPT services nationally will move from seeing around 15% of all people with anxiety and depression each year to 25%, and all areas will have more IAPT services.
•	Focusing on people with long term conditions. Two thirds of people with a common mental health problem also have a long-term physical health problem, greatly increasing the cost of their care by an average of 45% more than those without a mental health problem. By integrating IAPT services with physical health services the NHS can provide better support to this group of people and achieve better outcomes.
•	Supporting people to find or stay in work. Good work contributes to good mental health, and IAPT services can better contribute to improved employment outcomes.
•	Improving quality and people's experience of services. Improving the numbers of people who recover, reducing geographic variation between services, and reducing inequalities in access and outcomes for particular population groups are all important aspects of the development of IAPT services.

1705,"DPS for Voluntary, Charitable and Social Enterprises (VCSE's) for ad hoc and lower value Goods, Services and Works",Orbit Group Limited,"This Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) is intended to be a platform to lower the barriers of entry and encourage VCSE's (Voluntary, Charitable and Social Enterprises) and similar organisations such as Sheltered Workshops (organisations employing disadvantaged workers) to tender for smaller and lower value goods, services and works in and outside of the wider public sector, where specific requirements and non-core work is required. There are real challenges in enabling social value to be applied effectively primarily because organisations have conflicting pressures on delivery, risk, scale and cost management which vary. 

Orbit is passionate about building communities and investing in our communities. It is hoped that the growth of social suppliers is increased by working with Orbit and similar organisations across the housing and wider public and other sectors. There is an increasing desire to buy from VCSE's and this desire is being driven by organisational ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) approaches, a generational shift in expectations along with the direction of travel of government led initiatives such as PPN's 0620 and 1120, the industrial and civil society strategies and the Social Value Act. 

Suppliers will need to click on the link to view this opportunity on Procontract and 'register interest' to view and download the documents and complete application. Please contact beth@supplychange.co.uk if you need any assistance. 

This DPS will be open for use for the wider Public and other sectors who want to increase their commitment to Social Value. Please contact group.tenders@orbit.org.uk for further information.

With the changing nature of the clinical and policy response required by new strains emerging, surges of activity and new vaccines becoming available, the vaccine deployment strategy has been developmental and has required the Authority to react to circumstance to ensure vaccines could be administered as effectively as possible. As more is now known about COVID-19 the Authority is now able to look towards the future and the development of a stable and effective strategy for COVID-19 vaccine deployment and wider immunisation programmes. 

One of the requirements of the Authority is to ensure stability and continuity in the deployment of the COVID-19 vaccine and respond to any requirements, including new JCVI recommendations.  

In designing the future strategy the Authority recognises the need to hear from a wide range of stakeholders, which will help in determining the right provider mix and / or deployment model for the future of the COVID-19 vaccination programme and support the development of an integrated strategy for all NHS immunisation programmes. To this end the Authority is taking a staged approach:

1.	July 2022 to Summer 2023 - Stabilise the current delivery model to minimise any impact on the current COVID-19 deployment up to the summer of 2023.
2.	Summer 2022 - Seek to engage with the market to gain further information and insight to assist the Authority in developing a strategy for the future management and deployment of vaccinations.
3.	Autumn to Spring 2022/23 - Develop a procurement strategy that enables the delivery of an integrated approach to vaccinations in 2023/24.

The Authority expects to combine information provided as part of this market engagement process with insight derived from local systems' existing experience, plus evaluation of some innovative potential models of delivery, to develop a commissioning framework that enables an integrated approach to vaccinations in 2023/24.  The Authority may seek support from the supply market to deliver these models.  

However, the Authority is now asking suitable, qualified and competent suppliers, able to manage and deploy vaccines, to indicate willingness to participate in a market engagement process and support the Authority in the design of its future strategy.

1726,Marketing T Level Qualification - Market Engagement (Wave 5),The Institute for Apprenticeship & Technical Education,"The purpose of this PIN is to initiate market engagement and it is not being used as a call for competition. This PIN is intended to:

1. Inform the market of the upcoming procurement process for the Wave 5 Marketing T Level, being commissioned by the Institute for Apprenticeships and Technical Education (IfATE) (and therefore enable the market / potential suppliers to begin to plan for this); and

2. Advise as to the upcoming forthcoming market engagement event which will be held virtually via Microsoft Teams on 12th July 2022, with presentations from key note speakers about the forthcoming Wave 5 T Level procurement. There will also be one to one sessions offered where suppliers can meet with the procurement team, and a workshop on how to bid for public contracts.

IfATE will be the contracting authority, subject to commencement of the relevant provisions of the Technical and Further Education Act 2017.of the Technical and Further Education Act 2017. References to IfATE should be read with this in mind.

T Levels are a new programme of Technical Education that will introduce a high quality technical option alongside an academic option for students aged 16 to 19. This is being implemented following the recommendation by the Independent Panel on Technical Education - the Sainsbury report. The Sainsbury Report also recommended that a single body or consortium should deliver each qualification under an ""exclusive licence"" that would be awarded for a fixed time period following open competition. The purpose of the proposed procurement will be to select and appoint an Awarding Organisation (AO) to be responsible for developing and delivering the Wave 5 T Level qualification, under an exclusive licensing approach.

The expected scope of the role of the AO is that it would be responsible for:- designing the content of the qualification;- upskilling providers (further education schools and colleges);- providing of learning and teaching materials;- updating content; and- delivering qualification assessment services.

The pathway in scope for the Wave 5 Procurement is :Marketing

Finalised outline content for the pathway will be available on the IfATE website at https://www.instituteforapprenticeships.org/t-levels/final-outline-content/ in due course.

1740,C21478 - Data Product Development and Associated Services,Home Office,"The Home Office's Data Services & Analytics (DSA) Unit intends to put in place a new £35m-£40m contract over a 4 year (+ Optional 12 months extension) term, with a single Service Provider for the provision of end-to-end Data Product Development and Associated Services across DSA's current and future portfolio of products and customers.

DSA products are growing in their uptake and business-criticality. They are all at various stages of maturity and are becoming more reusable, with more shared code, and are becoming more able to serve multiple Home Office customers rather than single business areas. Thus, there is a need to grow and mature existing products and to build on the development work done already to deliver new products and services to the wider Home Office.

The Service Provider will be required to provide product team(s) that can deliver new products and enhance existing products. They will be proficient with cloud-based technologies, building and using data pipelines and large data sets, using Agile methodologies, and will also provide third-line support and DevOps product support.

The Home Office intends to conduct a formal Early Market Engagement (EME) event with Digital Programmes and Specialists (RM6263) Lot 1 - Digital Programmes Framework Suppliers.

The event will.

• Provide suppliers with an overview of the requirement, bidding process and aim to address any initial questions.

• Be held remotely via MS Teams or other similar method.

The EME event is to be held on the confirmed date of Thursday 30th June (09:30-12:30).

UKHSA is therefore seeking applications from potential providers to be admitted to the DPS. UKHSA envisages that the DPS will be divided into the categories of products (Lots) with differential characteristics for the LFT and PCR lots (more fully described in the relevant Specifications). UKHSA currently intends to run procurements within the DPS to seek tenders from those providers who have qualified onto the DPS and whose kits fall within one or more of the relevant lots. Potential providers may join the DPS at any time up to the date the DPS expires so long as the potential provider meets the criteria stated in the documents found on the appointed esourcing platform (Atamis). If a potential provider meets the criteria for admission to the DPS and is appointed to a lot then it may be invited to tender for the award of one or more contracts. UKHSA envisages using specific criteria which may, where appropriate, be formulated more precisely in the Invitations to Tender for those procurements. 
For LFT requirements UKHSA does not seek to procure kits which are exclusively nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or exclusively both.

1745,Multiply: Digital Platform to Improve Adult Numeracy Skills through the Provision of Online Training and Tuition,Department for Education,"**THIS PIN NOTICE IS TO NOTIFY SUPPLIERS OF AN UPCOMING REQUIREMENT THAT WE ANTICIPATE WILL BE ADVERTISED USING CCS' RM6219 LEARNING AND TRAINING SERVICES DPS. SERVICE TYPE: LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES**

**SECOND MARKET ENGAGEMENT EVENT REARRANGED - SEE BELOW FOR DETAILS**

We have provided high-level detail on service requirements below - please see Attachments for further information (also available on Jaggaer).

Multiply is a new programme aimed at improving functional numeracy skills across the United Kingdom. Multiply is aimed at all adults over 19 who do not already have a Level 2 Maths Qualification (or equivalent) - whether in employment or unemployed. They can either be working towards a Maths GCSE or Functional Skills qualification or equivalent, need specific numeracy skills for their work or progression, or just want to brush up on the skills to help them get on in life and work. 

A critical pillar of the programme is the Multiply national digital numeracy platform which will be launched later in 2022. The platform will act as the national ""front door"" to Multiply - giving people the ability to learn at their own place and pace. Through the platform, we want to build the confidence of learners, and help them take the stepping stones towards a maths qualification. We also intend to signpost to course in local areas. We'd also like to see employers using the online platform, e.g. through helping them assess their workforce needs, and signposting to local training.

This requirement therefore has several components: a digital learning platform, platform content, and an online tuition offer. Across all three, we would like the platform to provide a diagnostic tool to assess skills levels (e.g. identify strengths and weaknesses) to help guide learners through the learner offer; and recognise a learner's progress.

The platform is funded from the 2022-2023 financial year, through to the end of the 2024-2025 financial year.

The Department is carrying out a Discovery that will continue to inform our assumptions on volumes and service requirements (including number of learners).

The platform should meet the Government's Service Standard to ensure it is secure, robust, and accessible. This includes accessibility to WCAG v2 AA standard, and Cyber Essentials Plus. This is in addition to the minimum service requirements associated with RM6219.

The platform, content and tutoring must also be provided in Welsh for users in Wales.  

Finally, we expect the Multiply site to be both Multiply, UK Government and DfE branded.",Opportunity,23-Jun-22,Administrative educational services - 75121000. Management-related services - 79420000.

They are a mechanism by which an individual's Personal Budget, agreed by a Social Worker, is held by a third party organisation (i.e. neither by the Local Authority nor the Service User) who is trusted by the client to help them find the care and support they need in the local community, be it access to Day Services, a Personal Assistant (PA), equipment needs, live-in care, social prescribing or signposting to other services and voluntary organisations that will help them achieve their agreed outcomes, or indeed a combination of all of the above. It is a form of Self-Directed Support.

ISFs are particularly appropriate when service users do not feel confident enough or have the capacity to manage the financial and employer responsibilities of a Direct Payment on their own but still prefer to exercise personal choice and control over how their agreed care and support needs are met.

We will therefore be seeking to procure new contracts to deliver education services in prisons across England.

Our vision is that everyone of working age and able to work should leave prison prepared for employment or further education and training. The new service will therefore expand the scope of 'prison education', bringing together areas of learning, skills and work into one transformative service. This will facilitate better outcomes for prisoners on release and ultimately contribute to reducing reoffending.

To achieve this vision, we are seeking to procure new education contracts by engaging with a diverse range of providers and suppliers that can offer prisoners a range of learning opportunities.

In issuing this Prior Information Notice, the MoJ is seeking to inform the market of this planned procurement with a view to initiating a series of market consultations in the near future.

The MoJ intends to hold a market engagement launch event on 26th April 10:45 to 12:15  via MS Teams webinar.

The Framework will be in place for up to 10 years and will enable providers to join at any time (as long as specific criteria is met) instead of fixed opening periods (as is the case with the existing Frameworks). It will work in two stages as follows:
•	Part I: The overarching 10 year framework will open and detail specific lots. At this stage providers need to meet the minimum entry criteria, this is detailed when the framework is open. At this stage providers will be asked to complete minimum entry criteria for the Lots they may in future wish to participate in further competitions for. 
•	In Part 2 providers will be invited further competition which will include further quality / price evaluation processes in respect of  ""specific call off""s. It is anticipated that this process will commence from April 2022.
The Framework shall allow a variety of procurement methods in order to support flexibility; opportunities to expand Providers' geographical reaches and to respond to the needs of Service Users in receipt of Direct Payments or Personal Health Budgets. These shall include but are not limited to: 

•	Brokerage of individual packages 
•	Fixed term block contracts 
•	Individual Service Funds (ISF)  

The Framework shall remain open for providers to apply to be appointed onto the Framework at any time during the Term, including those who have previously applied and failed to become a Framework provider (but excluding any whose Framework Agreement and/or Call-Off Contract has been terminated for Contract Non-Compliance). Framework providers may re-apply to improve their standing on the Framework by applying to be appointed to additional Lots.",Opportunity,,Health and social work services - 85000000,England,"£1,700,000,000",DORST001-DN548158-59398419,21-Mar-22,31-Mar-32, 5pm, 1 April 2032, 2 April 2032,Service contract,Open procedure,Yes,Yes,Tom Smith,"Dorset Council, County Hall, Colliton Park, Dorchester, DT1 1XJ, United Kingdom",,Tom.smith@dorsetcouncil.gov.uk,https://www.dorsetcouncil.gov.uk ,,,,

Associated OJEU Contract Notice publication number: 2018/S 037-080867.


Innovate UK is establishing a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) as a means of awarding contracts for monitoring services.

Innovate UK provides grant funding to individuals and organisations involved in developing technology and science innovations. It is vital for Innovate UK that the performance and progress of publicly funded projects are monitored to ensure that the funding is used properly and effectively.

The DPS is divided into a 48 Lots based on the different areas of innovation to which the innovation projects relate. 

The DPS is a completely electronic tendering system through which Monitoring Services Providers (MSPs) can apply to be admitted to a specific Lot. Interested parties must specify which Lots they are applying to join. Admission to a Lot or Lots is no guarantee of work, but Innovate UK's intention would be to invite tenders from MSPs within Lots for future Monitoring Services opportunities.

The DPS will remain open and valid from the start date of 23rd February 2018 for an initial period of two years, with the option to extend the operation of the DPS for two further 12 month periods.

See attached documents for DPS Overview and DPS Rules. 

MSPs can apply to join the DPS at any time in the life of the DPS by completing the registration details at https//innovateuk.force.com/s/registration-page .


About Innovate UK and UKRI.

Innovate UK is the UK's innovation agency. We are
an executive non-departmental public body sponsored
by the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial
Strategy (BEIS) and are incorporated as the
Technology Strategy Board by Royal Charter in
England and Wales.
In April 2018 changes will be made to the structure of
the UK's research and innovation bodies (including
Innovate UK). A new body corporate will be
established under the Higher Education and Research
Act 2017 that brings together the UK's seven
Research Councils, Innovate UK and a new
organisation, Research England. This new body will
be known as UK Research and Innovation (""UKRI"").
With the establishment of UKRI, Innovate UK
(Technology Strategy Board) will cease to exist as a
body corporate in its own right and will become a
committee or 'Council' of UKRI. Innovate UK will
continue to administer contract and grant funding and
to manage the relationship with MSPs as a Council of
UKRI. However, existing contracts awarded by
Innovate UK under the DPS will be transferred to
UKRI under a statutory transfer scheme and future
contracts awarded under the DPS will be entered into
by UKRI. More information about UKRI is available

      Invest East is a 3-year business support project part funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and delivered by four partners. Led by Norfolk County Council, with delivery partners Suffolk County Council, New Anglia Local Enterprise Partnership (NALEP) and the University of East Anglia, Invest East is a programme of specialised business support for Norfolk and Suffolk based businesses with high growth aspirations. The project has three key areas: an investor support programme, promotion and profile raising and an investment readiness programme (IRP).

      Invest East's Investment Readiness Programme is for SMEs in Norfolk and Suffolk who are preparing to take on investment to develop and grow their business. The Investment Readiness Programme is being delivered by the University of East Anglia. It will run for three years and will see multiple cohorts of businesses taken through a programme of one to one advisor support, mentoring, seminars, pitching cycles, networking events and tailor made professional support to get them in the best shape to take on investment of any type or size to grow their business. 

      UEA is seeking interest from suitably qualified and experienced individuals from a wide range of backgrounds to form a pool of experienced professionals who can mentor and work with businesses to help them reach their full potential.

The MWDPS will also be made available for use by Gov. Facility Services Limited, a MoJ wholly owned company responsible for the total facilities management of 48 prisons across the South of England, to source subcontractors to support its maintenance and project activities
. 
Call-off contracts let under the MWDPS will have a maximum contract value of £1,000,000 GBP, however we expect the majority of projects to have a contract value of <£500,000 GBP. 

The procurement will be undertaken in accordance with Regulation 34 of the Public Contracts Regulations 2015.

 The MWDPS will operate across England, Wales and Scotland and is divided into five (5) headline Lots:-
-  Building Structure and Groundworks,
-  Mechanical Engineering incl. HVAC,
-  Electrical Engineering incl. Security,
-  Demolition Work
-  Multidisciplinary Construction Work

Each of the Lots are further subdivided into Categories.

There is a desire to attract a broad range of Contractors to be part of the MWDPS.  The number of Contractors appointed to the MWDPS is unlimited.

The MWDPS will initially be in operation for Four (4) years with an option to extend for a further two (2), two (2) year terms, at the sole discretion of the Authority, making a total of eight (8) years.  However, the duration may be varied (reduced or extended) in line with emerging business needs

The estimated spend for the first 4 years of the MWDPS is £296,000,000 GBP (£74,000,000 GPB per annum made up of £64,000,000 GBP per annum for project work and £10,000,000 per annum for maintenance related activity).

The MWDPS, in itself, is not a works contract.  Call Off Competitions will be held under the MWDPS for specific Projects or maintenance contracts.  The proposed terms and conditions to be used for the Call Off Contracts are the NEC: Engineering & Construction Short Contract for Project Work and the NEC Term Services Contract for maintenance work, however consideration is also being given to a bespoke set of terms and conditions for straightforward or very low value works.

Individual call off project durations may be as short as 2 weeks but could be as long as 9 months. Maintenance contracts may be let for in excess of one year.",Opportunity,,"Solar panels - 09331000.

1952,River Thames Scheme - Construction Partner - Market Engagement,Defra Network eTendering Portal,"This notice is only an invitation to express interest to participate in a market engagement exercise for the River Thames Scheme. The Environment Agency and Surrey County Council, through a collaboration partnership, are issuing this PIN for the purpose of seeking organisations that wish to take part in Market Engagement exercises, Phase 1 to Phase 5 before we start a formal procurement process, for which a separate contract notice will be issued. Organisations should ensure that they express their interest for all the relevant phases of the market engagement process so that their intent is correctly noted by the Environment Agency. 

The Environment Agency has already developed outline design proposals and an initial procurement and contract strategy for the delivery phases of the River Thames Scheme, which will involve a range of works to reduce flood risk from the River Thames between Egham Hythe, Staines and Teddington weir. The Environment Agency intends to test this strategy and the outline design proposals through Phase 1, 2 and 3 of the Market Engagement whilst undertaking the Environmental Impact Assessment and preparing for the consenting process.

Our current project programme intends to initiate publishing a contract notice and the tender documents in the autumn of 2022 with contract award anticipated in summer 2024 (subject to required approvals). We are seeking feedback from the supply market to help us shape our current strategy, design, contracting and risk management proposals to ensure delivery in the most efficient and effective way.

The Environment Agency are looking to bring on board a Construction Partner for the River Thames Scheme. Our current project programme aims to initiate a procurement exercise in autumn of 2022 with contract award anticipated summer 2024 (subject to required approvals).

Up to July 2020, the RTS included a flood channel in three sections but, following confirmation of the funding position, channel section 1 is now removed. The scope of the Construction Partner Contract and main works include the detailed design and construction of new flood channel built in 2 channel sections:​

1953,GP Services Purchasing System (PDPS) for APMS contracts: GP services and GP Caretaking services,NHS Arden and Greater East Midlands Commissioning Support Unit,"NHS England and NHS Improvement (NHSEI) is seeking to launch a new online purchasing system (technically known as a 'Pseudo' Dynamic Purchasing System or PDPS) where pre-approved GP providers can apply to join a list of pre-approved providers.
Those providers approved to join the system can then be invited by local commissioners to bid to provide APMS services when local needs arise.

The PDPS is a 4-year procurement exercise managed through a new e-procurement platform and will see:

GP providers appointed to an electronically managed list of approved providers



GP providers can apply and be added to this list at any time during the 4-year period, unlike a traditional procurement framework,



once approved onto the PDPS, GP providers can be invited via the e-platform to respond to requests for APMS services from local commissioners. These local 'call-offs' will be matched to the bespoke needs of local commissioners.


To ensure the PDPS can be managed efficiently while also being sensitive to local commissioner (and provider) needs it will be broken down in to Lots

Lot 1 - Substantive APMS Contracts

Lot 2 - GP Caretaker Contracts

The PDPS will be further broken down into geographical sub-Lots (7 sub-Lots in line with the 7 NHSEI regional areas). GP Providers can apply to be an approved APMS and/or caretaker provider in one or more of the stated Lots and Sub-Lots.

Application on to the approved provider list does not commit providers to providing APMS services, nor does it guarantee a provider will be awarded a contract through the PDPS, but it does mean providers will be able to bid when local needs arise. Applications to join the PDPS will be managed in consecutive ""Rounds"". These Rounds have specific start and end dates by which applications must be submitted. If a provider misses the deadline to submit an application for a particular Round, they can submit their application for evaluation as part of the next Round.

Please refer to the online document set available at the EU Supply e-tendering portal (link above) for further details.

      - Uncompetitive tenders on a regular basis 
      - Poor response or no responses to tender enquires
      - Financial data changes (assessed at least yearly) - assessed against original SSQ submission. Could either lead to complete removal or dropping out of some lots but not others. Could also lead to others growing to a state where qualify for higher lots.

2017,Young People's Supported Accommodation Dynamic Purchasing System,Derby City Council,"This procurement is to develop a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) that will ensure quality and safe provision for Children in Care, Care Leavers, Children in Need, and Homeless 16 & 17-year olds. 

Individual call offs from the DPS will support young people to develop independent living skills and assist toward step down and their own accommodation. The DPS will have providers with a range of accommodation and support packages who will bid for referrals put out by the Commissioning and Placements Team. 

The service is required to ensure that the local authority fulfils its duty towards Looked after Children and Children who are homeless by providing sufficient local accommodation and prevent the use of Bed and Breakfast provisions for 16 - 18 year olds. There is a statutory duty to provide this provision.  

If we do not have appropriate safe accommodation for our young people, we will not be meeting the duty as a corporate parent and risk vulnerable young people being at risk of exploitation.

This is a re-tender of an existing framework; however we now intend to procure services by way of a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS), which will allow more flexibility and the potential for new Providers to join during the contract period.

Each individual contract will be subject to a Secondary Competition process and with new providers able to join the DPS at any point, this should enable us to secure a price for services that is competitive and reflective of the market at that time. In exceptional circumstances direct awards may be undertaken dependant on the needs of the young person.

There is the option for Nottingham City Council Nottinghamshire County Council and Derbyshire County Council to use the DPS for Secondary Competitions and Direct Awards. 

The DPS is scheduled to run until 31st March 2024. 

Applications are made in a series of rounds that open and close at the discretion of the Council. The latest round closed on 30th November 2020. 

The DPS is currently paused to further applications  to allow the Council sufficient time to  review likely requirements over the coming months, specifically the numbers of potential placements required, the needs of our children and young people and ensure quality of the current provision to deliver as broad a range of accommodation and support as possible. We hope to have completed this by Spring of 2021 and may re-open a new round for applications at that point.

UPDATE MARCH 2020
Update due to an IT upgrade taking place (23/03/2020 - 27/03/2020) for the DPS. The new pqq_28831 has replaced the previous pqq reference. There has been the addition of five new Service Lines. Please see updated attachments containing details of the Service Lines and how to apply, in Other Information.

As set out in the Green Paper 'Improving Lives: Work, Health and Disability' , published in October 2016, the department is looking to deliver a number of new proof of concept' (PoC) to improve the support that it can offer and to understand what best works.

This is a Contract Notice for social and specific services in accordance with Directive 2014/24/EU Article 24.  The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) intends to establish a Dynamic Purchasing System (DPS) to procure these activities in in England, Scotland and Wales.  The DPS is for the procurement of social and other services referred to in Regulation 74 of the Public Contracts Regulations (2015) and as such, the intention is to use a light touch regime, rather than the full regime described in Regulation 34 (Dynamic Purchasing System).

This DPS will present opportunities for organisation, with a focus on innovation and local specialist support, to be involved and test the development of new approaches for employment and health related activity.  This will be key to building evidence to support the delivery of future provision at both national and local level.

At this stage we cannot confirm or guarantee any future business through the DPS but it is anticipated that there will be some limited numbers of proof of concepts in specific parts of the country in the next 6-12 months.  However, it is expected that as the DPS develops the activity will increase involving most, if not all, parts of the country.

The T&L DPS will commence on the first date that DWP signs the first DPS Contract, expected to be in November 2018.  The T&L DPS will be open ended, but can be terminated by the Authority with twenty (20) Working Days' notice.  The expectation is that it will run for four years.
The expected total value of all Call-Off contracts for the DPS will be approximately £2 million for 2018-19.  Thereafter funding for DPS procurement will be annually agreed (amounts to be confirmed), and may include monies from other funding streams.

This DPS will be for the use of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), its Executive Agencies and those Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) sponsored by DWP. Further information including a list of such Agencies and Public Bodies can be viewed by selecting 'Ministerial Departments' on the Departmental website.

Some of these outlets are arranged on a joint basis with our partner Councils, Gateshead and Sunderland, and administered by the Joint Waste Partnership. Others are arranged directly by the Council, and it is these that fall within the scope of this DPS.
The range of materials encompasses cardboard, scrap metal, high and low quality wood, mixed plastics, carpets, mattresses, waste engine oil, gypsum board (plaster wallboard), rubble, vehicle tyres and trade waste recycling (paper / cardboard / glass jars and bottles / cans / plastic bottles).
The requirement relating to each material is to provide a delivery point to receive the material, to then arrange its processing (perhaps through a series of stages and outlets) such that the maximum amount of recyclable content is passed into the supply chain, and the Council is able to demonstrate that recycling in its inputs to the national Wastedataflow database.
Services
Whilst the main waste treatment and disposal services are properly covered, there are a number of services that fall outside the scope of any Partnership arrangement, and which include:
•	The receipt and processing of abandoned vehicles and caravans.
•	The provision of a collection, delivery and emptying service for hooklift containers
•	The provision of a skip hire (e.g., 6 / 8 m3 skips) service for allotment sites and other locations
•	The collection and processing of scrap plastic wheeled bins

2188,Modified Dynamic Purchasing System for the Procurement of Apprenticeship Training Providers,Lincolnshire County Council,"Lincolnshire County Council is setting up a Modified Dynamic Purchasing System (MDPS) to support the procurement of Apprenticeship Training for the Council and its Maintained Schools.  Suppliers must be registered on the Education and Skills Funding Agency's (ESFA) Register of Apprenticeship Training Providers - details of which can be found here https://www.gov.uk/guidance/register-of-apprenticeship-training-providers.  In order to provide Lincolnshire County Council and its maintained schools with apprenticeship training, suppliers will need to join the MDPS.  Through this we will issue requests for Delivery Plans for inclusion within our Catalogue of Apprenticeship Provision.  Delivery Plans will be evaluated against quality criteria, and as long as  they meet or exceed the quality threshold of 70%, the suppliers offer will be added to the Catalogue.  This Catalogue will be circulated to the Councils corporate departments and its maintained schools, where recruiting officers can perform desk based evaluations to identify the offer that most closely meets their needs.    This procurement activity will cover all apprenticeship training needs up until March 2023, with the option to extend until March 2028.  As and when new needs are identified, new Delivery Plan requests will be issued via the MDPS.
